<p>The names of Mr. John Rivers,&mdash;kinsman and agent of
Lord Ashley,&mdash;Dr. Wm. Scrivener and Margaret Tudor
appear in the passenger list of the <i>Carolina</i>, as given in
the Shaftesbury Papers (Collections of the South Carolina
Historical Society, Vol. V, page 135). In the same (page
169) may be found a brief account of the capture, at Santa
Catalina, of Mr. Rivers, Capt. Baulk, some seamen, <i>a
woman, and a girl</i>; also (page 175) mention of the unsuccessful
embassy of Mr. Collins; and (page 204) the
Memorial to the Spanish Ambassador touching the delivery
of the prisoners, one of whom is alluded to as <i>Margaret</i>,
presumably Margaret Tudor.</p>

<p>The names of the two Spaniards, Se&ntilde;or de Colis and
Don Pedro Melinza, each appear once in the Shaftesbury
Papers (pages 25 and 443): the latter individual was
evidently a person of some consequence in San Augustin;
the former, in the year 1663, was "Governour and Captain-General,
Cavallier, and Knight of the Order of St.
James."</p>

<h1>THE STORY OF MARGARET TUDOR</h1>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">San Augustin</span>, this 29th of June, Anno
Domini 1670.</p>

<p>It is now more than a month since our captivity
began, and there seems scant likelihood
that it will come to a speedy close,&mdash;altho',
being in good health myself, and of an age
when hope dies slowly, I despair not of recovering
both liberty and friends. Yet, in the
event of our further detention, of sickness or
any other evil that may befall me&mdash;and there is
one threatening&mdash;I write these pages of true history,
praying that they may some time reach
the hand of my guardian and uncle, Dr. William
Scrivener, if he be still alive and dwelling
in these parts. Should they chance, instead, to
meet the eyes of some friendly-disposed person
of English blood and Protestant faith, to whom
the name of William Scrivener is unknown, I
beseech him to deliver them to any person
sailing with the sloop <i>Three Brothers</i>, which
did set out from the Island of Barbadoes on
the 2nd of November last,&mdash;being in the hire of
Sir Thomas Colleton, and bearing freight and
passengers for these shores.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>If the sloop has suffered some misadventure
(as I fear is not unlikely,&mdash;either at the hands
of the Spaniards, or else of the Indians of these
parts, who do show themselves most unfriendly
to all Englishmen, being set on to mischief by
the Spanish friars), then I pray that word may
be forwarded to his Lordship, the Duke of
Albemarle, and others of the Lords Proprietors
who did commission and furnish a fleet of
three vessels, to wit: the <i>Carolina</i>, the <i>Port
Royal</i>, and the <i>Albemarle</i>, which did weigh
anchor at the Downs in August of last year,
and set forth to plant an English colony at
Port Royal.</p>

<p>In particular would I implore that word
might reach Lord Ashley, seeing that his kinsman,
Mr. John Rivers, is here detained a prisoner
in sorry state, laden with chains in the
dungeon of the Castle&mdash;for which may God
forgive me, I being in some degree to blame;
and yet, since it hath pleased Heaven to grant
me the fair face that wrought the mischief, I
hold myself the less guilty and grieve the more
bitterly, inasmuch as I love him with a maid's
true love and would willingly give my life to
spare him hurt.</p>

<p>If it were so that I might give the true narrative
of our present plight, and how it fell
about, without cumbering the tale with mention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of my own name, it would please me
best; but as those who read it may be strangers,
I would better tell my story from the
start.</p>

<p>Of myself it is enough to say that my name
is Margaret Tudor, and saving my uncle, Dr.
Scrivener, I am alone in the world and well-nigh
portionless&mdash;my father having spent his
all, and life and liberty to boot, in the service
of King Charles, being one of those unfortunate
royalists who plotted for His Majesty's
return in the year '55. For, as Cromwell did
discover their designs ere they were fully ripe,
many were taken prisoners, of whom some
suffered death and others banishment. Of
these last was my father, who was torn from
the arms of his young wife and babe and sent
in slavery to Barbadoes. We could learn
nothing of his after fate, though many inquiries
were made in his behalf.</p>

<p>And so it fell about that,&mdash;my mother having
gone to her rest,&mdash;I did take passage with my
uncle, Dr. William Scrivener, on board the
<i>Carolina</i>, with intent to stop at Barbadoes and
make some search for my poor father in the
hope that he yet lived.</p>

<p>Among the passengers of the <i>Carolina</i> was
Lord Ashley's kinsman and agent, Mr. John
Rivers, of whom I can find naught to say that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
seems fitting; for although it may hap that in
this great world there are other men of a
countenance as fine, a mien as noble, and
a heart as brave and tender, it has not been
my lot as yet to encounter them.</p>

<p>Together we did sail for three months on
the great deep, in danger of pirates, in peril of
tempests, and in long hours of golden calm
when the waters burned blue around us and
the wide heaven shone pale and clear over our
heads. And in all that time we came to know
one another passing well; and Mr. Rivers
heard my father's story and promised to aid us
in our search.</p>

<p>It was October when we reached Barbadoes
and landed. Of the news that we obtained,
and the strange chance that brought it to our
ears, it is needless here to speak. Let it suffice
that my dear father did not suffer long, as
death soon freed him from his bondage.</p>

<p>We had no further cause to detain us in
Barbadoes, so we yielded to the persuasions of
Mr. Rivers that we should continue with the
expedition to Port Royal; and, in November,
we set sail once more in the <i>Three Brothers</i>, a
sloop hired to replace the <i>Albemarle</i>, which,
in consequence of a broken cable, had been
driven ashore in a gale and lost upon the
rocks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>From now on, for the truth's sake, I must
needs tell somewhat of my intercourse with Mr.
Rivers. It may seem I am lacking in a proper
modesty if I declare that, even then, there was
more than friendship betwixt us. But surely
there were reasons enough and to spare. That
I should love him was no mystery&mdash;he being
the gallant gentleman he is; and, since there
chanced to be no other maid upon the vessel
of proper age and gentle condition, I suppose
it was in nature that he should make the best
of the little society he had. But nay, I
would be false to my own faith if I doubted
that it was foreordained of Heaven that we
should come together and love one another.</p>

<p>It is true that I did not make confession of
this belief until I had tormented my would-be
lord with every teasing device that entered into
my brain. But though he was often cast down
for hours together, he gave me to understand
that he could read my heart in my blue eyes.</p>

<p>"An you were to swear upon your soul you
hated me, dear lady, I'd not believe it," he once
said. "Mistress Margaret is too unversed in
city ways and shallow coquetries to play a part&mdash;and
'tis for that I love her so." And though
it angered me to have him praise my innocence
and country airs, I knew he spoke the truth,
and that a time would come when I would
own my love for him. And so it did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>A terrible storm had raged for eight-and-forty
hours. There had been wild, black, awful
nights, and sullen days when the gray curtains
of the sky were torn asunder and whirled over
us in inky folds, their tattered fringes lashing
up the seas, and whipping our frail bark till it
skulked and cowered, like a beaten cur that
looks in vain for mercy. We had drifted northward
far from our course, our two consorts
had disappeared, and we had well-nigh given
up hope, when with the dawning of the third
day the wind lulled, and through the ragged
clouds we saw the blue arch of heaven high
above us.</p>

<p>I had climbed out upon the deck alone; and
from a sheltered corner I saw the sun rise and
gild a far-off strip of shore that lay to west of
us. It seemed a vision of a new heaven and
a new earth, and I gave God thanks. Then a
hand touched mine, and a voice whispered my
name&mdash;and other words that need not be
recorded here; and I could answer nothing in
denial, for the reason that my heart was too
full.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> land to west of us was Virginia, and we
sought harbour at Nancemund, and lay there
some weeks for needful repairs on the sloop,
which was also provisioned afresh for her
further voyage.</p>

<p>It was then the month of February; we had
been six months a-journeying, and still the
promised land was far away.</p>

<p>This tale of mine, however, bids fair to spin
itself at too great length, so I must hasten on
to the story of our captivity.</p>

<p>In spite of fairly good weather on our way
southward we somehow over passed the latitude
of Port Royal harbour; and of a Saturday
in May&mdash;the fifteenth day of the month&mdash;we
did cast anchor at a little isle upon the coast, in
order to obtain wood and water for the sloop's
needs.</p>

<p>This island is within the territory of the
Spaniards, who have named it Santa Catalina.
It lies some days' journey north of San Augustin,&mdash;the
exact latitude I know not, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
I have heard it more times than one; but there
are some things that abide never in a woman's
brain.</p>

<p>Here appeared many Indians, who seemed
at first not unfriendly, and spoke words of welcome
to us in the Spanish tongue.</p>

<p>Much trading was done aboard the sloop, and
the barbarians appeared strangely content with
strings of paltry beads and the cast-off garments
of the crew, giving in their stead good
provender, and skins of the wild deer dressed
soft and fine.</p>

<p>The second day of our stay, Mr. Rivers, with
the ship's master and three seamen, went
ashore with such stuff as the Indians desire, to
trade for pork and other provisions; and it
being a Monday morn, Dame Barbara did crave
leave to take her washing and go with them, in
the hope of finding a softer water to cleanse
the linen.</p>

<p>It was early morning; the breeze from the
land blew sweet and fragrant, and the woods
beyond the sandy beach bourgeoned in new
leafage, green and tender. I longed for the
scent of the warm earth, and the tuneful courting
of bird-lovers in the thicket; so I prayed
my uncle to let me go ashore with the dame.
He acceded willingly enough; but Mr. Rivers,
who is always over-anxious where my safety is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
concerned, counselled me earnestly not to
leave the ship.</p>

<p>I was ever a headstrong maid, and the sunshine
and the scent of far-off flowers had set
me nearly wild with longing; so I chid him
roundly for his caution and merrily warned
him to beware how he sought to clip the wings
of a free bird. Go I did, therefore, though he
smiled and shook his head at me; and when
we all parted company at the watering-place
he seemed uneasy still, and, looking backward
over his shoulder as I waved farewell, entreated
me to wander no farther from the shore.</p>

<p>The little spring where they had left us
welled up, cold and clear, at the foot of a tall
cypress-tree, and trickled thence in a tiny
stream, a mere thread of crystal, that tangled
itself in the low bush and wound its way helplessly
through the level wooded country, as
though seeking for some gentle slope that
would lead it to the sea.</p>

<p>The dame rinsed her linen till it fairly shone,
and spread it out to dry in a sunny nook; while
I lay prone on the warm earth and stirred up
the damp brown leaves that had drifted into a
tiny hollow, and found beneath them a wee
green vine with little white star-flowers that
blinked up at the sun and me. And I dreamed
of the new home we would make for ourselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in this far country, and of the very good and
docile wife I would be to my dear love. Then
at last,&mdash;because I grew aweary at the prospect
of my very great obedience in the future, and
because, too, I thought it was high time my
gallant gentleman came back to ask me how I
did,&mdash;up from the ground I started, rousing
the dame from a sweet nap.</p>

<p>"Look, Barbara! the linen is dry; the sun is
on its westering way, and the shadows grow
longer and longer.&mdash;'Tis very strange that Mr.
Rivers and the master have not returned!"</p>

<p>"Mayhap they have clean forgot us and
gone back to the ship alone," moaned the old
woman, rubbing her sleepy eyes and beginning
at once to croak misfortune, after the manner
of her class.</p>

<p>Such an idea was past belief and set me
smiling. I laid my hollowed palms behind my
ears and listened.</p>

<p>Master Wind, passing through the tree-tops,
had set every leaf a-whispering and nid-nodding
to its gossips,&mdash;just as the peddler on his
way through the village at home stirs all the
women-folk to chattering about the latest news
from the whole countryside. In the thicket
beside us a chorus of feathered singers were
all a-twitter, each trying to outdo his neighbour;
but one saucy fellow piped the merriest tune<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of all, mingling in a delicious medley the
sweetest notes of all the rest. Of a sudden,
as I listened, there was a soft rustle in the
undergrowth, and out from a clump of myrtles
bounced a little brown rabbit, who cocked an
astonished eye at me and disappeared again
with a series of soundless leaps and a terrified
whisk of his little white tail. Upon that the
laugh in my throat bubbled over; I dropped
my hands and turned to the dame.</p>

<p>"Gather up your linen, good Barbara, and
let us explore the trail ourselves. They are
doubtless picnicking somewhere in the woods
beyond, and 'tis very discourteous not to bid
us to the entertainment."</p>

<p>She would have demurred at first: the linen
was not to be left, and yet was too weighty to
carry; her back was aweary and she was fain to
rest in peace. But Mistress Margaret was
minded to have her own way, and, dividing
the bundle in two, started on ahead with the
larger share of it; so that, will she, nill she, the
dame must follow.</p>

<p>I knew, of course, that I was disobeying Mr.
Rivers's last injunction, and 'twas that thought
quite as much as the sweet woodland airs that
lured me on: I desired, above all things, to
behold the countenance of my gallant gentleman
when he discovered my wilfulness. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I hastened forward, pausing now and again to
encourage the good dame and entice her still
farther with glowing descriptions of new beauties
just coming into view.</p>

<p>It fell about, therefore, that I was some
forty paces in advance of her when I suddenly
came upon the Indian settlement and saw
there a sight that made my heart stand still.</p>

<p>I drew back hastily behind the trunk of a
wide-branched oak, whence I could look&mdash;unseen,
I thought&mdash;upon the town.</p>

<p>A great concourse of barbarians was assembled
in the open space before the chief building,
which was of considerable size, built round
after the manner of a dove-house, and completely
thatched with palmetto leaves. Many
smaller buildings surrounded it: one, in especial,
I would have done well to take note of; for it
was doubtless a kind of sentinel or watch-tower,
being set on tall, upright timbers which gave
it an elevation much greater than any part of
the surrounding country.</p>

<p>I had eyes for naught, however, but one
figure, that stood, with hands and feet bound,
at the foot of a great wooden cross planted
opposite the entrance of the chief building.
It was my dear love&mdash;I knew him on the
instant by the proud poise of his head and
shoulders. He was speaking in his usual calm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and courtly tones to the circle of half-naked
savages, who seemed to hear him with respectful
consideration, though they made no motion
to loose his bonds.</p>

<p>On the ground beside him lay the ship's
master, old Captain Baulk, and the three seamen,
their arms securely pinioned. Near
them was the bale of goods which had been
brought from the ship: it lay wide open, and
was being most unscrupulously rifled of its
contents.</p>

<p>For the moment I thought it was the sight
of the gewgaws this bale contained that had
roused the cupidity of the barbarians; but now
I believe otherwise. The savages would have
paid for them willingly, in skins and such like,
and then suffered our men to depart in peace,
had not that smooth-tongued hypocrite, Ignacio,
been behind. But this, of course, was
unknown to me at the time.</p>

<p>The idea came over me, like a flash, that we
should go for help to the ship; and I turned
quickly and signalled the dame to be silent.
It was too late, however, for she had caught
sight of the savages and of our men bound in
the midst of them; and turning to the right
about with a shrill scream, she cast away the
bundle of linen and started back the way we
had come at a speed which 'tis likely she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
never equalled in her life before. After her I
hastened, and implored her to be still, lest
the barbarians should hear and overtake us.
My one thought was to summon aid; for,
though there seemed to be over two hundred
of the Indians, I believed that our handful of
men, armed with muskets, swords, and pikes,
would be sufficient to strike terror into them
at once.</p>

<p>We had scarce run an hundred yards down
the trail when four savages stepped from a
thicket and laid hands upon us. They had
lain in wait, there is no doubt, so 'twas evident
we had been seen some while before.</p>

<p>Barbara resisted them with much wild
shrieking, but I submitted in silence. 'Twas
not that I was any braver than she, but simply
that I could not believe that they meant to do
us any real harm; and all the while I was possessed
with the thought that there was some
one stationed in the thicket who was directing
the actions of the savages. It appeared to
me that, as they fastened our arms behind
us, their eyeballs rolled ever toward a certain
myrtle-bush, as if they were waiting for a
cue.</p>

<p>We were led back at once to the town, and
I shall never forget the look upon my dear
love's face as he caught sight of me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Margaret&mdash;you also! I had hoped you
and the dame were safe!" he cried out, as
our captors led us to his side.</p>

<p>"'Twas all my wilfulness&mdash;I came hither
seeking you," I answered, and hung my head.</p>

<p>He looked at me dumbly, and then turned
his face away; and I saw his arms writhing in
their bonds. A strange feeling came upon
me, part shame and sorrow that I should have
grieved him so, and part exultation that&mdash;whatever
our fate&mdash;at least we would meet it
side by side. Fear had the least place in my
thoughts as I waited, breathless, for the outcome
of this strange situation. My eyes
wandered round the circle of barbarians, and
I noted with some wonderment that numbers
of the men wore their crowns shaven,
after the manner of a priest's tonsure.</p>

<p>One among them, who seemed of greater
consequence than the rest, began to speak;
but I could make nothing of his discourse,
although he used many words that I thought
had somewhat of a Spanish ring.</p>

<p>Yet his meaning was fathomed by Mr.
Rivers, who gave him the reply on the instant,
couched in the Spanish, and delivered with
some heat and indignation.</p>

<p>There was a stir among the barbarians, and
presently there appeared a new figure on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
scene. The shaven crown, the bare feet, the
coarse woollen robe fastened by a knotted
cord about the waist, all denoted a friar of
the Franciscan order.</p>

<p>"So," muttered Mr. Rivers, under his breath,
"now we have the real chief to deal with."</p>

<p>Scarcely less swarthy than the Indians
themselves was the dark face of the Spanish
friar. As he came forward into the open
space, he raised his eyes to the great cross at
the foot of which we were standing, and
straightway bent the knee and crossed himself.
Some few of the Indians likewise made the
sign upon their breasts, though the greater
part contained themselves with the same
stolidity that had marked them from the first.</p>

<p>Mr. Rivers gave a low laugh, and turned to
me with a curling lip. "These be Christians,"
he said.</p>

<p>The Spaniard caught the sneer, and a scowl
gathered on his coarse face; but he checked
it suddenly and began in smooth tones to
address us.</p>

<p>Old Captain Baulk had raised himself to a
sitting posture, and the seamen all held themselves
in attitudes of strained attention.</p>

<p>"What says he?" I asked, in a whisper, of
my dear love, when the friar had ceased and
turned away from us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Naught but a tissue of lies," exclaimed
Mr. Rivers, through his clenched teeth. "He
would have us believe that he is wholly irresponsible
for the doings of these 'banditos';
but he will exert what influence he has among
the believers of his flock to procure our release,&mdash;I
would we had fallen among infidels!
These can have learned naught of their teacher
but deceit. They tricked us, on the plea of
our most mutual confidence, to lay aside our
arms, and then fell instantly upon us and
made us captive."</p>

<p>"I would to Heaven I could have gone
back to the ship and given warning," I sighed
dolefully. "Yet perhaps some of them may
come out to search for us."</p>

<p>"Now God forbid!" exclaimed Mr. Rivers,
"for they would walk into a trap. Some of
these Indians have muskets and ammunition,
and are therefore as well armed as our men.
If many more of us were taken there would
not be left able-bodied men enough to sail the
sloop. 'Twould be better if they held off and
waited for the Indians to take the initiative.
My hope is that we will be able to treat with
the savages for ransom,&mdash;that is, if the friar
bears us no real ill will. See, here he comes
again, with his oily tongue."</p>

<p>The shifty eyes and full-lipped mouth of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
man filled me with a sudden loathing. Fear
began to take hold of me at last, and a little
sob broke in my throat.</p>

<p>My dear love turned to me with a quick,
warm glance.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, sweetheart," he whispered. "It
is too soon to lose courage. Come, where is
my brave Margaret?"</p>

<p>"Here!" I answered, and forced a smile on
my quivering lips.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rest of the day passed by like a long
nightmare. The friar had us removed to a small
but strongly built hut, containing two rooms,
separated by a thin partition of hides nailed
to a row of upright studs. These were of
squared timber, as was the floor also, and the
outer frame and wall-plate. The roof and
sides were overlaid with thatch; and there
was no window, only a square opening in the
roof which admitted the light, and also let out
the smoke when a fire was built upon the
floor.</p>

<p>As dark came on, two young Indian girls
entered the hut, where we sat, bound, with
our backs against the wall.</p>

<p>They seemed kindly disposed and gentle-mannered,
for all their outlandish garb, which
consisted of a petticoat of long gray moss, and
strings of little shells and beads of divers
colours festooned about the neck.</p>

<p>They loosed Barbara and me, for which we
were mightily grateful, as our arms had grown
numb and sore. We made signs that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
should cut the bonds of the men also, which
they declined to do. Yet they touched us
with gentle hands, and stroked our shoulders
in token of their good will.</p>

<p>After this they brought wet clay and spread
it upon the floor, and on this laid a fire and
kindled it; going forth again, they returned
with food and set it before us, making signs
that we who were free should feed the rest.</p>

<p>While I was serving my dear love&mdash;who
made pitiable pretence of enjoying my ministrations&mdash;the
friar entered the hut, accompanied
by two others who were doubtless of
mixed Spanish and Indian blood.</p>

<p>They bore with them heavy manacles and
chains, which they fastened upon our men,
cutting the leathern thongs which had held
them until now.</p>

<p>Mr. Rivers demanded to know by whose
orders this was done.</p>

<p>"For it would seem our true jailers are not
the Indians. These fetters are of Spanish
forging. Is it to your nation, padre, we are
indebted for this urgent hospitality?"</p>

<p>To this the friar made answer at great length,
and what he said appeared to enrage our men,
who broke forth in a round volley of oaths as
soon as our jailers had left the hut. I turned
to Mr. Rivers for explanation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis as I supposed," he said, "and the
friar is at the bottom of it all. He maintains
now that in landing here and attempting to
trade with the Indians we have committed an
offence against the sovereignty of Santo
Domingo, which claims all this coast as
Spanish territory. These Indians, he declares,
are under the protection of his government,
and therefore are not free to dispose of any
goods to us English, or to receive any favours
at our hands; as such dealings would be to
the prejudice of the Spanish rights and
influence over this country. Therefore he
has claimed us from the Indians and proposes
himself to hold us prisoners, awaiting the
decision of the Governor at San Augustin."</p>

<p>As I look back now, it seems to me that in
those first hours of our captivity I grew older
by many years. That gladsome morning, with
its wilful moods and joyous daring, fell away
back into the past, and seemed as unreal as
the day-dreams of my childhood.</p>

<p>We slept that night, Dame Barbara and I,
upon a soft and springy couch of moss piled
in the little inner room. That is to say, we
lay there silently; but I think I scarce closed
my eyes.</p>

<p>The wind, drifting through the gaping
thatch, caught the loose corner of a shrivelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
strip of hide dangling on the rude partition
wall, and kept it swinging back and forth, with
a faint tap-tap, tap-tap, the whole night long.
As it swung outward I could catch fleeting
glimpses of the little group huddled about the
dying fire; and for hours I lay and listened to
the low murmur of their voices and the heavy
clank and rattle of their chains.</p>

<p>Old Captain Baulk was in a garrulous mood,
and he poured into the sailors' ears a horrid
tale of how the Spaniards had massacred the
first French settlers on this coast.</p>

<p>"'Twas just about one hundred years ago,"
he droned in a gruesome whisper. "Ribault's
settlement was on the River May, somewhere
in these latitudes. There were about nine
hundred of them in all, 'tis said, counting the
women and children; and not one of them
escaped. The bodies of dead and wounded
were alike hung upon a tree for the crows&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In God's name, hold your croaking
tongue!" Mr. Rivers broke in angrily. "'Tis
bad enough for the women as things are, and
if they overhear these old wives' tales, think
you it will make them rest easier?"</p>

<p>"Not old wives' tales, Mr. Rivers, but the
fact, sir,&mdash;the bloody fact."</p>

<p>"Silence!" whispered my betrothed, in a
voice that made me tremble,&mdash;for he hath a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
hot temper when it is roused. "Unless thou
canst hold that ill-omened tongue of thine,
there presently will be another bloody fact
between thy teeth!"</p>

<p>A sudden silence fell. 'Twas broken finally
by my dear love, whose generous nature soon
repented of a harshly spoken word.</p>

<p>"I was over-hasty, my good Baulk; but I
would not for the world have Mistress Tudor
hear aught of those horrors. And times have
changed greatly in an hundred years. But
this inaction, this inaction! 'Tis terrible upon
a man!"</p>

<p>A suppressed groan accompanied the exclamation,
and my heart ached for him. It
must indeed be hard for men&mdash;who are used
to carving their own fates and wresting from
fortune their desires&mdash;suddenly to be forced
to play the woman's part of patient waiting.</p>

<p>The next day brought no relief.</p>

<p>From the windowless hut we could see
naught of what passed without; but about an
hour before noon we heard a drum beat in the
village. The sound grew ever fainter, as
though receding; then came the distant report
of musketry, and we grew anxious for
our people on the sloop. Hours passed by,
and again came the sound of heavy firing,
which gradually died away as before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we were joined by
another prisoner, whom&mdash;from his dress of
skins&mdash;we mistook at first sight for a young
Indian; but 'twas no other than the lad Poole,
who was in Mr. Rivers's service and most
loyally attached to his master.</p>

<p>From him we learned that the Indians and
some Spaniards had been parleying with our
men all day. He had swum ashore with a
letter to the friar, and had been received with
kindness by the savages, who clad him after
their own fashion. The friar, however, vouchsafed
him no reply; and after a time gave a
signal to his men to fire on the sloop. The
arrows of the Indians and the muskets of the
Spaniards had finally compelled the <i>Three
Brothers</i> to weigh anchor and put out to sea.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> after day dragged by. We grew
aweary of discussing the possibilities of our
escape and fell gradually into silence.</p>

<p>It was on the first day of June that Don
Pedro de Melinza arrived in the galley from
San Augustin, and our captivity took on a new
phase.</p>

<p>He is a handsome man, this Spanish Don,
and he bears himself with the airs of a courtier&mdash;when
it so pleases him. As he stood that
day at the open door of our hut prison, in the
full glow of the summer morning, he was a
goodly sight. His thick black hair was worn
in a fringe of wavy locks that rested lightly
on his flaring collar. His leathern doublet
fitted close to his slight, strong figure, and
through its slashed sleeves there was a shimmer
of fine silk. In his right hand he held his
plumed sombrero against his breast; his left
rested carelessly on the hilt of his sword.</p>

<p>I could find no flaw in his courteous greetings;
but I looked into his countenance and
liked it not.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The nose was straight and high, the keen
dark eyes set deep in the olive face; but beneath
the short, curled moustache projected
a full, red under lip.</p>

<p>Show me, in a man, an open brow, a clear
eye, a firm-set mouth, and a chin that neither
aims to meet the nose nor lags back upon the
breast; and I will dub him honest, and brave,
and clean-minded. But if his forehead skulks
backward, his chin recedes, and his nether lip
curls over redly&mdash;though the other traits be
handsome, and the figure full of grace and
strength controlled&mdash;trust that man I never
could! Such an one I saw once in my early
childhood. My mother pointed him out to
me and bade me note him well.</p>

<p>"That man," she said, "was once your
father's friend and close comrade; yet now he
walks free and lives in ease, while my poor
husband is in slavery. Why is it thus? Because
he over yonder was false to his oath, to
his friends, and to his king. He sold them
all, like Esau, for a mess of pottage. Mark
him well, my child, and beware of his like; for
in these days they are not a few, and woe to
any who trust in them!"</p>

<p>I remembered those words of my mother
when the Se&ntilde;or Don Pedro de Melinza y de
Colis made his bow to us that summer's day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
The meaning of his courtly phrases was lost
upon me; but I gathered from his manner
that he had come in the guise of a friend,&mdash;and
I trembled at the prospect of such friendship.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I was right glad when the
fetters were struck from my dear love and his
companions, and we were taken upon the
Spanish galley and served like Christians.</p>

<p>At the earliest opportunity Mr. Rivers
hastened to make things clear to me. "Our
deliverer"&mdash;so he termed him, whereat I
marvelled somewhat,&mdash;"our deliverer assures
me that Padre Ignacio's action is condemned
greatly by his uncle, Se&ntilde;or de Colis, the Governor
and Captain-General at San Augustin.
Don Pedro has been sent to transport us
thither, where we will be entertained with
some fitness until we can communicate with
our friends."</p>

<p>"Says he so? 'Twill be well if he keeps his
word; but to my thinking he has not the
face of an honest man."</p>

<p>Mr. Rivers looked at me gravely. "That
is a hard speech from such gentle lips," he
said. "Don Pedro is a Spanish gentleman of
high lineage. His uncle, Se&ntilde;or de Colis, is a
knight of the Order of St. James. Such hold
their honour dear. Until he gives us cause to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
distrust him, let us have the grace to believe
that he <i>is</i> an honest man."</p>

<p>I looked back into the frank gray eyes of
my true and gallant love, and I felt rebuked.
'Twas a woman's instinct, only, that made me
doubt the Spaniard; and this simple trust of
a noble nature in the integrity of his fellow
man seemed a vastly finer instinct than my
own.</p>

<p>From that moment I laid by my suspicions,
and met the courteous advances of Se&ntilde;or de
Melinza with as much of graciousness as I
knew how. But, as we spoke for the most
part in different tongues, little conversation
was possible to us.</p>

<p>I marvelled at the ease with which Mr.
Rivers conversed in both Spanish and French.
Of the latter I was not wholly ignorant myself,&mdash;although
in my quiet country life I had
had little opportunity of putting my knowledge
to the test, seldom attempting to do
more than "prick in some flowers" of foreign
speech upon the fabric of my mother tongue;
so it was with great timidity that I essayed at
first to thread the mazes of an unfamiliar
language.</p>

<p>The Spaniard, however, greeted my attempts
with courteous comprehension, and
after a time I was emboldened to ask some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
questions concerning the town of San Augustin,
and to comment upon the vivid beauty
of the skies and the blue waves around us.
Upon that he broke into rapturous praises of
his own land of Spain&mdash;"the fairest spot upon
the earth!" As I listened, smilingly, it
seemed to me that I perceived a shadow gathering
upon the brow of my dear love.</p>

<p>So far the galley had depended solely upon
her oars&mdash;of which there were six banks, of
two oars each, on either side,&mdash;but now, the
wind having freshened, Don Pedro ordered
her two small lateen sails to be hoisted.
While he was giving these directions and
superintending their fulfilment, Mr. Rivers
drew closer to my side, saying, in a rapid
whisper:</p>

<p>"You have somewhat misread me, sweetheart,
in regard to your demeanour toward
our host. 'Tis surely needless for you to put
yourself to the pain of conversing with him at
such length."</p>

<p>Now it must be remembered that in the last
few hours our situation had greatly changed.
I had left a dark and dirty hovel for a cushioned
couch upon a breezy deck. In the tiny
cabin which had been placed at my disposal, I
had, with Barbara's aid, rearranged my tangled
locks and my disordered clothing; so that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was no longer ashamed of my untidy appearance.
With my outward transformation there
had come a reaction in my spirits, which
bounded upward to their accustomed level.</p>

<p>The salt air was fresh upon my cheek; the
motion of our vessel, careening gaily on the
dancing waves, was joyous and inspiring. I
forgot that we were sailing southward, and
that, if our English friends had survived to
begin their intended settlement, we were leaving
them farther and farther behind. My
thoughts went back to the earlier days of our
journey over seas; and a flash of the wilful
mischief, which I thought had all died from
my heart, rose suddenly within me.</p>

<p>I leaned back upon my cushioned seat and
looked with half-veiled eyes at my gallant
gentleman.</p>

<p>"These nice distinctions, Mr. Rivers, are
too difficult for me," I said. "If this Spanish
cavalier of high lineage and honest intentions
is worthy of any gratitude, methinks a few
civil words can scarcely overpay him."</p>

<p>A heightened colour in the cheek of my betrothed
testified to the warmth of his feelings
in the matter, as he replied:</p>

<p>"You are wholly in the right, my dearest
lady! If civil words can cancel aught of our
indebtedness I shall not be sparing of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Nevertheless, permit me, I entreat you, to
assume the entire burden of our gratitude and
the whole payment thereof."</p>

<p>"Not so," I rejoined, with some spirit.
"Despite our beggared fortunes, I trust no
one has ever found a Tudor bankrupt in either
courtesy or gratitude; and&mdash;by your leave,
sir&mdash;I will be no exception!"</p>

<p>This I said, not because I was so mightily
beholden to the Spaniard; but&mdash;shame upon
me!&mdash;because Mr. Rivers had chosen to reprove
me, a while since, for my uncharity.</p>

<p>'Tis passing strange how we women can
find pleasure in giving pain to the man we
love; while if he suffered from any other
cause we would gladly die to relieve him!
'Twould seem a cruel trait in a woman's character&mdash;and
I do trust that I am not cruel!
But I must admit that when I greeted Don
Pedro, on his return, with added cordiality, it
was nothing in his dark, eager countenance
that set my heart beating&mdash;but rather the
glimpse I had caught of a bitten lip, a knotted
brow, and a pair of woeful gray eyes gazing
out to sea.</p>

<p>Repentance came speedily, however. There
was that in the Spaniard's manner that aroused
my sleeping doubts of him; and I soon fell
silent and sought to be alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>My gallant gentleman had withdrawn himself
in a pique, and, in the company of old
Captain Baulk and the lad Poole, seemed to
have wholly forgotten my existence.</p>

<p>I made Dame Barbara sit beside me, and,
feigning headache, leaned my head upon her
shoulder and closed my eyes. The dame
rocked herself gently to and fro, and from
time to time gave vent to smothered prayers
and doleful ejaculations that set my thoughts
working upon my own misdoings.</p>

<p>Through my half-shut eyes I saw the sun
go down behind the strip of shore, and
watched the blue skies pale to faintest green
and richest amber. A little flock of white
cloudlets, swimming in the transparent depths,
caught fire suddenly and changed to pink
flames, then glowed darkly red like burning
coals, and faded, finally to gray ashes in the
purpling west.</p>

<p>"Lord, have mercy on our sinful hearts!"
groaned Dame Barbara softly.</p>

<p>"Amen!" I sighed, and wondered what
ailed mine, that it could be so very wicked as
to add to the burden of anxiety that my dear
love had to bear! A few tears stole from under
my half-closed lids, and I was very miserable
and forlorn, when suddenly I felt a hand
laid upon mine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>I looked up hastily, and saw the face of my
gallant gentleman, very grave and penitent, in
the fast-deepening twilight. My heart gave
a glad leap within my bosom; but I puckered
my lips woefully and heaved a mighty sigh.</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear Dame, for your kind
nursing," I said to Barbara. "Truly, I know
not what I should do without your motherly
comforting at times."</p>

<p>Mr. Rivers took my hand, and drew me
gently away, saying:</p>

<p>"See what a bright star hangs yonder, above
the sombre shores!"</p>

<p>I glanced at the glittering point of light,
and then, over my shoulder, at the shadowy
decks. The Spaniard was not in sight, and
only the bent figure of the dame was very
near.</p>

<p>My dear love raised my fingers to his lips.
"Forgive me, sweetheart, for being so churlish&mdash;but
you cannot know the fears that fill
me when I see that man's dark face gazing
into yours, and realize that we are utterly in
his power."</p>

<p>"Surely he would not harm me!" I said,
hastily.</p>

<p>"'Tis that he may learn to love you," said
Mr. Rivers gravely.</p>

<p>"He may spare himself the pain of it!" I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
cried. "Have you not told him that we are
betrothed?"</p>

<p>"Aye, love&mdash;but he may lose his heart in
spite of that. What wonder if he does?
The miracle would be if he could look upon
your face unmoved."</p>

<p>"Am I so wondrous pretty, then?"</p>

<p>"Fairer than any woman living!" he declared.
I knew well enough it was a tender
falsehood, but since he seemed to believe it
himself it was every whit as satisfactory as if
it had been truth!</p>

<p>"Be comforted," I whispered, reassuringly.
"I know very well how to make myself quite
homely. I have only to pull all my curls back
from my brow and club them behind: straightway
I will become so old and ugly that no
man would care to look me twice in the face.
Wait till to-morrow, and you will see!"</p>

<p>A laugh broke from Mr. Rivers's lips, and
then he sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"Nay, sweetheart, if it be the head-dress
you assumed one day some months ago for
my peculiar punishment, I pray you will
not try its efficacy on the Spaniard; for it
serves but to make you the more irresistible."</p>

<p>But already I have dwelt longer upon myself
and my own feelings than is needful for
the telling of my tale. I must hasten on to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
those happenings that more nearly concerned
Mr. Rivers. Yet, in looking backward, I find
it hard to tear my thoughts from the memory
of that last hour of quiet converse with my
dear love, under the starlit southern skies.
How seldom we realize our moments of great
happiness until after they have slipped away!
It seemed to me then that we were in the
shadow of a dark-winged host of fears; but
now I know that it served only to make our
mutual faith burn the more brightly.</p>

<p>I did not, thereafter, neglect Mr. Rivers's
warning, and avoided the Spaniard as much as
possible. My dear love lingered always at
my elbow, and replied for me, in easy Spanish,
to all the courteous speeches of Don Pedro.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think it would have been far
better had he left me to follow my own course.
There are some men who need only a hint of
rivalry to spur them on where of their own
choice they had never thought to adventure.
Melinza's attentions did not diminish, while his
manner toward Mr. Rivers lost in cordiality as
time went on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the Spaniard's followers was a
young mulatto whom he called "Tomas."
Very tall and slight of figure was he, yet
sinewy and strong, with corded muscles twining
under the brown skin of his lean young limbs.
He wore a loose shirt, open at the throat,
with sleeves uprolled to the shoulder; and
his short, full trousers reached barely to the
knee.</p>

<p>I was admiring the agile grace of the lad
as he bestirred himself upon the deck the last
morning of our voyage. With him young
Poole (clothed once more like a Christian, in
borrowed garments) was engaged in the task
of shifting a great coil of rope; and the sturdy,
fair-skinned English youth was a pretty contrast
to the other.</p>

<p>Don Pedro was standing near to Mr. Rivers
and myself, and his eyes took the same direction
as our own.</p>

<p>"They are well matched in size," said he,
pointing to the lads. "Let us see which can
bear off the palm for strength." He called out a
few words in Spanish to the young mulatto, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
raised his dark head&mdash;curled over with shiny
rings of coal-black hair&mdash;and showed a gleaming
row of white teeth as he turned his smiling
face toward his master.</p>

<p>Mr. Rivers spoke a word to Poole, and the
boy blushed from brow to neck, and his blue
eyes fell sheepishly; but he stood up against
the other with a right good will, and there
was not a hair's difference in their height.</p>

<p>At a signal from Don Pedro the lads
grappled with each other; the brown and ruddy
limbs were close entwined, and with bare feet
gripping the decks they swayed back and
forth like twin saplings caught in a gale.</p>

<p>In the first onset the mulatto had the best
of it; his lithe dark limbs coiled about his
adversary with paralyzing force: but soon
the greater weight of the English youth began
to tell; his young, well-knit figure straightened
and grew tense.</p>

<p>I saw a sudden snarl upon the other's
upturned face. His short, thick upper lip
curled back upon his teeth as a dog's will
when in anger. He rolled his eyes in the
direction of his master, who threw him a contemptuous
curse. Stung into sudden rage, the
mulatto thrust forth his head and sank his
sharp white teeth in the shoulder of young
Poole.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a startled cry, and the English
youth loosened his grasp. In another moment
the two figures rolled upon the deck, and the
flaxen head was undermost.</p>

<p>"Foul play!" cried Mr. Rivers, springing
forward to tear the lads apart; for now the
mulatto's fingers were at his opponent's
throat.</p>

<p>Melinza's hand flew to his sword; with a
volley of oaths he interposed the shining blade
between Mr. Rivers and the writhing figures
on the floor. Quick as thought another blade
flashed from its sheath, and the angerful gray
eyes of my betrothed burned in indignant
challenge.</p>

<p>I had looked on in dumb amaze; but at the
sight of the naked weapons I screamed aloud.</p>

<p>Instantly the two men seemed to recollect
themselves. They drew back and eyed each
other coldly.</p>

<p>"<i>Hasta conveniente ocasion, caballero!</i>"
said the Spaniard, returning his sword to its
scabbard, and bowing low.</p>

<p>"<i>A la disposicion de vuestra se&ntilde;oria, Don
Pedro</i>," replied my betrothed, following his
example.</p>

<p>And I, listening, but knowing no word of
the language, believed that an apology had
passed between them!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The scuffle on the deck had ceased when
the swords clashed forth, and the lads had
risen to their feet. Melinza turned now to
young Tomas and struck him a sharp blow on
the cheek.</p>

<p>"Away with you both!" said the gesture
of his impatient arm; but I believe his tongue
uttered naught but curses.</p>

<p>All of our English had appeared upon the
deck, and when Melinza strode past them
with a scowl still upon his brow they exchanged
meaning glances. Captain Baulk
shook his grizzled head as he approached
us.</p>

<p>"What have I always said, Mr. Rivers"&mdash;&mdash;he
began; but my betrothed looked toward me
and laid a finger on his lip. Afterward they
drew apart and conversed in whispers. What
they said, I never knew; for when Mr. Rivers
returned to my side he spoke of naught but
the dolphins sporting in the blue waters, and
the chances of our reaching San Augustin ere
nightfall.</p>

<p>"So," I thought, "I am no longer to be a
sharer in their discussions, in their hopes or
fears. I am but a very child, to be watched
over and amused, to be wiled away from
danger with a sweetmeat or a toy! And
truly, I have deserved to be treated thus. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
now 'tis time for me to put away childish
things and prove myself a woman."</p>

<p>I had the wit, however, not to make known
my resolutions, nor to insist on sharing his
confidence. I leaned over the vessel's side
and watched the silver flashing of the two
long lines of oars as they cut the waves, and I
held my peace. But in my heart there was
tumult. I had seen the glitter of a sword
held in my dear love's face!&mdash;and I grew cold
at the memory. I had coquetted with the
man whose sword it was!&mdash;and that thought
sent hot surges over my whole body. I shut
my eyes and wished God had made them less
blue; I bit my lip because it was so red. I
had not thought, till now, that my fair face
might bring danger on my beloved.</p>

<p>He stood at my side, so handsome and so
debonair; a goodly man to look upon and a
loyal heart to trust; not over-fervent in matters
of religion, yet never soiling his lips with
a coarse oath, or his honour with a lie! As I
glanced up at him, and he bent down toward
me, I suddenly recalled the disloyal caution of
our father Abraham when he journeyed in the
land of strangers; and I thought: "Surely
must God honour a man who is true to his love
at any cost of danger!"</p>

<p>So passed the day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>It was evening when we crossed the bar and
entered Matanzas Bay. The setting sun cast
a crimson glow over the waters; I thought of
the blood of the French martyrs that once
stained these waves, and I shuddered.</p>

<p>Outlined against the western sky was the
town of San Augustin,&mdash;square walls and low,
flat roofs built along a low, green shore. The
watch-tower of the castle fort rose up in
menace as we came nearer.</p>

<p>Upon the deck of the Spanish galley, hand
in hand, stood my love and I.</p>

<p>"Yonder is&mdash;&mdash;our destination," said Mr.
Rivers.</p>

<p>"Our prison, you would say," I answered
him, "and so I think also. Nevertheless, I
would rather stand here, at your side, than
anywhere else in this wide world&mdash;<i>alone</i>!"</p>

<p>He smiled and raised my fingers to his lips.
"Verily, dear lady, so would I also."</p>

<p>There was a rattle of heavy chains, and a
loud plash as the anchor slipped down in the
darkening waters.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were received by the Spanish Governor
immediately after our landing.</p>

<p>I had already pictured him, in my thoughts,
as a man of commanding presence, with keen,
dark eyes set in a stern countenance; crisp,
curling locks&mdash;such as Melinza's&mdash;but silvered
lightly on the temples; an air of potency, of
fire, as though his bold spirit defied the heavy
hand of time.</p>

<p>'Twas therefore a matter of great surprise
to me&mdash;and some relief&mdash;when, instead, I
beheld advancing toward us a spare little
figure with snow-white hair and a pallid face.
His small blue eyes blinked upon us with a
watery stare; his flabby cheeks were seamed
with wrinkles, and his tremulous lips twitched
and writhed in the shadowy semblance of a
smile: there was naught about him to suggest
either the soldier or the man of parts.</p>

<p>He was attired with some pretension, in a
doublet of purple velvet with sleeves of a
lighter color. His short, full trousers were
garnished at the knee with immense roses;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
his shrunken nether limbs were cased in silken
hose of a pale lavender hue, and silver buckles
fastened the tufted purple ribbons on his
shoes. On his breast was the red cross of St.
James&mdash;patent of nobility; had it not been
for that and his fine attire he might have
passed for a blear-eyed and decrepit tailor
from Haberdashery Lane.</p>

<p>I plucked up heart at the sight of this little
manikin.</p>

<p>"Can this be the Governor and Captain-General
of San Augustin?" I whispered in the
ear of my betrothed.</p>

<p>"'Tis not at the court of <i>our</i> Charles only
that kissing, or promotion, goes by favour!"
was his answer, in a quick aside. Then he met
the advancing dignitary and responded with
grave punctilio to the suave welcome that was
accorded us.</p>

<p>Melinza's part was that of master of ceremonies
on this occasion. He appeared to
have laid aside his rancour, and his handsome
olive countenance was lightened with an expression
of great benignance when he presented
me to the Governor as&mdash;"<i>the honourable and
distinguished se&ntilde;orita Do&ntilde;a Margarita de
Tudor</i>."</p>

<p>I looked up at Mr. Rivers with an involuntary
smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"My betrothed, your Excellency," he said
simply, taking me by the hand.</p>

<p>The blear-eyed Governor made me a compliment,
with a wrinkled hand upon his heart. I
understood no word of it, and he spoke no
French, so Mr. Rivers relieved the situation
with his usual ease.</p>

<p>This audience had been held in the courtyard
of the castle, which is a place of great
strength,&mdash;being, in effect, a square fort built
of stone, covering about an acre of ground,
and garrisoned by more than three hundred
men.</p>

<p>We stood in a little group beneath a dim
lamp that hung in a carved portico which
appeared to be the entrance to a chapel.
Captain Baulk and the rest were a little aloof
from us; and all around, at the open doors of
the casemates, lurked many of the swarthy
soldiery.</p>

<p>Suddenly light footsteps sounded on the
flagged pavement of the chapel in our rear, and
a tall, graceful woman stepped forth and laid
her hand upon my shoulder. Through the
delicate folds of black, filmy lace veiling her
head and shoulders gleamed a pair of luminous
eyes that burned me with their gaze.</p>

<p>She waved aside the salutations of the two
Spaniards and spoke directly to me in a rich,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
low voice. The sight of a woman was so
welcome to me that I held out both hands in
eager response; but she made no move to
take them: her bright eyes scanned the faces
of our party, lingering on that of my betrothed,
to whom she next addressed herself,
with a little careless gesture of her white hand
in my direction.</p>

<p>Mr. Rivers bowed low, and said, in French:
"Madame, I commend her to your good care."
Then to me: "Margaret, the Governor's lady
offers you the protection of her roof."</p>

<p>His eyes bade me accept it, and I turned
slowly to the imperious stranger and murmured:
"Madame, I thank you."</p>

<p>"So!" she exclaimed, "you can speak, then?
You are not dumb? I had thought it was a
pretty waxen effigy of Our Lady, for the padre
here," and she laughed mockingly, with a glance
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Another had joined our group, but his bare
feet had sounded no warning tread. The sight
of the coarse habit and the tonsured head
struck a chill through me. Two sombre eyes
held mine for a moment, then their owner
turned silently away and re-entered the chapel
door.</p>

<p>Melinza was standing by, with a gathering
frown on his forehead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Such condescension on your part, Do&ntilde;a Orosia,
is needless. We can provide accommodations
for all our English guests here in the
castle."</p>

<p>"What! Would Don Pedro stoop to trick
out a lady's boudoir?&mdash;Nay, she would die of
the horrors within these gloomy walls. Come
with me, child, I can furnish better entertainment."</p>

<p>I turned hastily toward my dear love.</p>

<p>"Go!" said his eyes to me.</p>

<p>Then I thought of Barbara, and very timidly
I asked leave to keep her by me.</p>

<p>"She may follow us," said the Governor's
lady carelessly, and sharply clapped her hands.
Two runners appeared, bearing a closed chair,
and set it down before us.</p>

<p>"Enter," said my self-elected guardian.
"You are so slight there is room for us both."</p>

<p>In dazed fashion I obeyed her, and then she
followed me.</p>

<p>I thought I should be crushed in the narrow
space, and the idea of being thus suddenly
torn away from my betrothed filled me with
terror. I made a desperate effort to spring
out again; but a soft, strong hand gripped my
arm and held me still, and in a moment we
were borne swiftly away from the courtyard
into the dark without.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>I wrung my hands bitterly, and burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"<i>O cielos!</i> what have we here?" cried the
rich voice, petulantly. "'Tis not a waxen
saint, after all, but a living fountain! Do not
drown me, I pray you. What is there to weep
for? Art afraid, little fool? See, I am but a
woman, not an ogress."</p>

<p>But 'twas not alone for myself that I feared:
the thought of my dear love in Melinza's
power terrified me more than aught else,&mdash;yet
I dared not put my suspicions into words. I
tried hard to control my voice as I implored
that I might be taken back to the fort and to
Mr. Rivers.</p>

<p>"Is it for the Englishman, or Melinza, that
you are weeping?" demanded my companion
sharply.</p>

<p>"Madame!" I retorted, with indignation,
"Mr. Rivers is my betrothed husband."</p>

<p>"Good cause for affliction, doubtless," she
replied, "but spare me your lamentations.
Nay, you may <i>not</i> return to the fort. 'Tis no
fit place for an honest woman,&mdash;and you seem
too much a fool to be aught else. Here, we
have arrived&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She pushed me out upon the unpaved street,
then dragged me through an open doorway,
across a narrow court filled with blooming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
plants, and into a lighted room furnished with
rich hangings, and chairs, tables, and cabinets
of fine workmanship.</p>

<p>I gazed around me in wonder and confusion
of mind.</p>

<p>"How does it please your pretty saintship?
'Tis something better than either Padre Ignacio's
hut or Melinza's galley, is it not? Are
you content to remain?"</p>

<p>"Madame," I said desperately, "do with me
what you will; only see, I pray you, that my
betrothed comes to no harm."</p>

<p>"What should harm him?" she demanded.
"Is he not the guest of my husband?"</p>

<p>"His guest, madame, or his prisoner?"</p>

<p>She gave me a keen glance. "Whichever r&ocirc;le
he may have the wit&mdash;or the folly&mdash;to play."</p>

<p>I wrung my hands again. "Madame,
madame, do not trifle with me!"</p>

<p>"Child, what should make thee so afraid?"</p>

<p>I hesitated, then exclaimed: "Se&ntilde;or de Melinza
bears him no good will&mdash;he may strive to
prejudice your husband!"</p>

<p>The Governor's wife looked intently at me.
"Why should Melinza have aught against your
Englishman?"</p>

<p>I could not answer,&mdash;perhaps I had been a
fool to speak. I dropped my face in my hands,
silently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Orosia leaned forward and took me by
the wrists. "Look at me!" she said.</p>

<p>Timidly I raised my eyes, and she studied
my countenance for a long minute.</p>

<p>"'Tis absurd," she said then, and pushed
me aside. "'Tis impossible! And yet&mdash;&mdash;a
new face, a new face and passably pretty.
Oh, my God, these men! are they worth one
real heart pang? Tell me," she cried, fiercely,
and shook me roughly by the shoulder, "has
Melinza made love to you already?"</p>

<p>"Never, madame, never!" I answered
quickly, frightened by her vehemence. "Indeed,
their quarrel did not concern me. 'Twas
about two lads that had a wrestling-match
upon the galley. And although they were
both angered at the time, there may be no ill
feeling between them now. I was foolish to
speak of it. Forget my imprudence, I pray
you!"</p>

<p>But her face remained thoughtful. "Tell
me the whole story," she said; and when I
had done so she was silent.</p>

<p>I sat and watched her anxiously. She was a
beautiful woman, with a wealth of dark hair,
a richly tinted cheek, glorious eyes, and a
small, soft, red-lipped, passionate mouth&mdash;folded
close, at that moment, in a scornful
curve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly she rose and touched a bell. A
young negress answered the summons. Do&ntilde;a
Orosia spoke a few rapid words to her in
Spanish, then turned coldly to me.</p>

<p>"Go with her; she will show you to your
apartment, and your woman will attend you
there later on. You must be too weary to-night
to join us at a formal meal, and your
wardrobe must be somewhat in need of
replenishing. To-morrow you shall have whatever
you require. I bid you goodnight!"&mdash;and
she dismissed me with a haughty gesture
of her white hand.</p>

<p>The chamber that had been assigned to me&mdash;which
I was glad to share with the good
Dame Barbara&mdash;was long and narrow. There
was a window at one end that gave upon the
sea; and through the heavy barred grating,
set strongly in the thick casement, I could look
out upon the low sea-wall, and, beyond that,
at the smooth bosom of the dreaming ocean,
heaving softly in the quiet starlight, as though
such a sorrow lay hidden in its deep heart as
troubled even its sleep with sighs.</p>

<p>If I pressed my face close against the bars
I could see, to the left of me, the ramparts of
the castle, where my dear love was. The slow
tears rose in my eyes as I thought that this
night the same roof would not shelter us, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
would there be the same swaying deck beneath
our feet.</p>

<p>While we had been together no very real
sense of danger had oppressed me; but from
the first hour of our parting my heart grew
heavier with forebodings of the evil and
sorrow which were yet to come.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> first all seemed to go well enough.
The Governor's lady was fairly gracious to
me; old Se&ntilde;or de Colis was profuse in his
leering smiles and wordy compliments, none
of which I could understand; I saw Mr. Rivers
and Melinza from time to time, and they
seemed upon good terms with each other: but
I did not believe this state of affairs could
last,&mdash;and I was right in my fears.</p>

<p>One night ('twas the twenty-second of June,
and the weather was sultry and oppressive;
the sea held its breath, and the round moon
burned hot in the hazy sky) the evening meal
was served in the little courtyard of the
Governor's house, and both Mr. Rivers and
Melinza were our guests.</p>

<p>This was not the first occasion on which we
had all broken bread at the same board; but
there was now an air of mockery in the
civilities of Melinza,&mdash;he passed the salt to
my betrothed with a glance of veiled hostility,
and pledged him in a glass of wine with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
smile that ill concealed the angry curl of his
sullen red lip.</p>

<p>'Twas a strange meal; the memory of it is
like a picture stamped upon my brain.</p>

<p>From the tall brass candlesticks upon the
table, the unflickering tapers shone down
upon gleaming damask and glistening silver,
and kindled sparks amid the diamonds that
caught up the folds of lace on the dark head
of Do&ntilde;a Orosia, and that gemmed the white
fingers clasping her slow-moving fan. Hers
was a beauty that boldly challenged men's admiration
and exacted tribute of their eyes.
The white-haired Governor paid it in full measure,
with a fixed and watery gaze from beneath
his half-closed lids, and a senile smile
lurking under his waxed moustache. But
whenever I glanced upward I met the eyes
of Mr. Rivers and Don Pedro turned upon
me; and I felt a strange thrill made up, in
part, of triumph that my dear love was not to
be won from his allegiance, and in part of terror
because there was that in the Spaniard's
gaze that betokened a nature ruled wholly by its
hot passions and a will to win what it craved
by fair means or by foul.</p>

<p>I could eat little for the heat and the pungent
flavour of strange sauces, so I dallied
with my plate only as an excuse for lowered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
eyes; and, although I listened all the while
with strained attention, the talk ran by too
swiftly for me to grasp any of its meaning.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 315px;">

"TO THE BRIGHTEST EYES AND THE LIPS MOST WORTHY
OF KISSES!"&mdash;<i>Page 55.</i></div>

<p>But Do&ntilde;a Orosia was neither deaf nor
blind; her keen black eyes had noted every
glance that passed her by. With a deeper
flush on her olive cheek, and a prouder poise
of her haughty head, she made to me at last
the signal for withdrawal.</p>

<p>The three gentlemen, glasses in hand, rose
from their seats; and, as we passed beneath
the arched trellis that led away from
the paved court into the fragrant garden, Don
Pedro lifted his glass to his lips with a gesture
in our direction, and exclaimed in
French:</p>

<p>"To the fairest face in San Augustin! To
the brightest eyes and the lips most worthy of
kisses! May the light of those eyes never be
withdrawn from these old walls, nor the lips
lack a Spanish blade to guard them from all
trespassers!"</p>

<p>The Governor, who understood not the
French words, lifted his glass in courteous
imitation of his nephew's gesture; but Mr.
Rivers coloured hotly and set down his upon
the table.</p>

<p>"I like not your toast, Se&ntilde;or Melinza,
whichever way I construe it. The face I hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
fairest here shall leave San Augustin the day
that I depart; and, since it is the face of my
promised wife, it needs no other sword than
mine to fend off trespassers!"</p>

<p>He, too, spoke in French; and as the words
passed his lips I felt the soft, strong hand of
Do&ntilde;a Orosia grasp my arm and drag me backward
among the screening vines, beyond the
red light of the tapers, where we could listen
unseen.</p>

<p>Melinza was laughing softly. "Se&ntilde;or Rivers
says he cannot construe my toast to his
liking; but perhaps if I give it him in the
Spanish tongue he may find the interpretation
more to his taste!" Then he lifted his
glass again and slowly repeated the words in
his own language, with a meaning glance
toward the Governor.</p>

<p>The old man drained his goblet to the dregs,
and then turned a flushed face upon the Englishman
and laid his hand upon his sword.</p>

<p>My dear love had no thoughts of prudence
left,&mdash;for Melinza's words had been a direct
charge of cowardice,&mdash;so for all answer he
took the frail goblet from the table and threw
it in the younger Spaniard's face.</p>

<p>There was a tinkle of broken glass upon the
stone pavement, and Melinza wiped the red
wine from his cheek. Then he held up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
stained kerchief before the eyes of my dear
love and spoke a few words in his softest
voice.</p>

<p>An angry smile flickered over the countenance
of my betrothed; he bowed stiffly in
response.</p>

<p>The blear-eyed Governor broke in hotly,
with his hand still upon his sword; his dull
eyes narrowed, and the blood mounted higher
in his wrinkled cheek: but his nephew laid a
restraining hand upon his arm, and, with another
laughing speech and a profound bow to
Mr. Rivers, pointed toward the door.</p>

<p>I saw the three of them depart through the
passageway that led to the street entrance.
I heard the creak of the hinges, and the clang
of the bars as they fell back into place. Then
a strong, sweet odour of crushed blossoms
turned me faint. I loosed my hold of the
screening vines and stepped backward with a
sudden struggle for breath.</p>

<p>The woman beside me caught my arm a
second time and drew me still farther away
down the moonlit path.</p>

<p>"Is he aught of a swordsman, this fine cavalier
of thine?" she demanded, grasping my
shoulder tightly and scanning my face with
her scornful eyes.</p>

<p>Then my senses came to me: I knew what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
had happened&mdash;what was bound to follow;
and I began to speak wildly and to pray her
to prevent bloodshed between them.</p>

<p>I scarce know what I said; but the words
poured from my lips, and for very despair I
checked them not. I told her of my orphan
state&mdash;of that lone grave in Barbadoes, and
the sad young mother who had died of a
broken heart; I spoke of the long, long journey
over seas, the love that had come into my
life, and the dreams and the hopes that had
filled our thoughts when we reached the fair,
strange shores of this new country; and I
prayed her, as she was a woman and a wife, to
let no harm come to my dear love.</p>

<p>"Ah! madame," I cried, "a face so fair as
yours needs not the championship of one
English stranger, who holds already a preference
for blue eyes and yellow hair. I grant
you that he has a sorry taste; but oh! I pray
you, stop this duel!"</p>

<p>She loosed her hand from the clasp of mine,
and looked at me a moment in silence; then
she laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"Thou little fool! Thou little blue-eyed
fool! What do men see in that face of thine
to move them so? A painter might love thee
for the gold of thy hair, thy white brow, and
thy blue eyes,&mdash;they would grace a pictured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
saint above a shrine,&mdash;but for a man's kisses,
and such love as might tempt him to risk his
very life for thee,&mdash;<i>cielos</i>! it is more than passing
strange." Then, as I stood dumb before
her, she tapped me lightly on the cheek.
"Go to! Art such a fool as to think that <i>either</i>
sword will be drawn for <i>my</i> beauty's sake?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night I had but little sleep.</p>

<p>About an hour after midnight there was a
great stir in the house and the sound of opening
doors and hurrying footsteps. The unwonted
noises terrified me. I leaned against
the door, with a heart beating thickly, and I
listened. What evil tidings did those sounds
portend? There was a loud outcry in a
woman's voice,&mdash;the voice of Do&ntilde;a Orosia.</p>

<p>I felt that I must know what havoc Fate
had wrought in the last hours. I looked at
Barbara&mdash;she slumbered peacefully on her
hard pallet; the moonlight, streaming through
the barred window, showed me her withered
face relaxed in almost childlike peacefulness.
I would not rouse her,&mdash;'twas a blessed thing
to sleep and forget; but <i>I</i> dared not sleep, for
I knew not what would be the horror of my
waking. With my cheek pressed close against
the door I waited a moment longer. Perhaps
only those planks intervened 'twixt me and
my life's tragedy!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>I laid my hand upon the latch. I feared to
know the truth,&mdash;and yet, if I did not hear it,
I must die of dread. Slowly I turned the key
and raised the bars: the door swung open.</p>

<p>I stepped out upon the balcony that overhung
the court and I looked over. There was
no one in sight; the white moonlight lay over
everything, and a strong perfume floated up
from the flowers in the garden beyond.</p>

<p>I crept down the stair and stood still in the
centre of the empty court. Voices sounded
near me, but I knew not whence they came.
Trembling still, I moved toward the passage
that led to the outer door, and I saw that it
was bright as day. The door stood ajar.
Those who had last gone out had been
strangely forgetful&mdash;or greatly agitated.</p>

<p>Scarce knowing what I did, I crossed the
threshold and hurried down the street in the
direction of the fort.</p>

<p>A group of three men stood upon the corner.
At the sight of them I paused and hid
in the shadow of the wall; but, one of them
turning his face toward me, I recognized
Captain Baulk, and, going quickly forward, I
laid my hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>"How is he? Where have they taken
him?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"What! is't Mistress Tudor? Have they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
turned you adrift, then? Lor', 'tis a frail craft
to be out o' harbour such foul weather!"</p>

<p>"How is he?" I repeated, tightening my
grasp upon his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Dead as a pickled herring, poor lad!"</p>

<p>My head struck heavily against the wall as
I fell, but I made no outcry.</p>

<p>"Sink me! but the poor lassie thought I
meant Mr. Rivers!" I heard the old sailor
exclaim as he dropped on his knees beside
me,&mdash;and the words stayed my failing senses.</p>

<p>"Whom did you mean?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Young Poole has been done to death,
Mistress Margaret. As honest a lad as ever
lived, too,&mdash;more's the pity!"</p>

<p>I struggled to raise myself, crying: "What
do you tell me? Have they killed the lad in
pure spite against his master? And where is
Mr. Rivers?"</p>

<p>They made me no answer.</p>

<p>"He is dead, then! I knew it, my heart
told me so!"</p>

<p>"Eh! poor lass! 'Tis not so bad as that&mdash;yet
bad enough. They've hung chains enough
upon him to anchor a man-o'-war, and moored
him fast in the dungeon of the fort. D&mdash;n
'em for a crew o' dastard furriners!&mdash;an' he
own cousin to an English earl!"</p>

<p>"Can you not tell me a straight tale?" I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
cried. "What has he done to be so ill served?
And whose the enmity behind it all,&mdash;Melinza's,
or the Governor's?"</p>

<p>"Lor'!" exclaimed one of the sailors, "the
young Don is past revenge, mistress. If he
lives out the night 'tis more than I look to
see."</p>

<p>"Here, now, let me tell the tale, lad," the
old captain interposed. "'Twas a duel began
it, Mistress Tudor. The young bloods were
so keen after fighting they could not wait for
sunrise, but must needs have it out by moonlight
on the beach. 'Twas over yonder, in
the lee of the castle walls."</p>

<p>"Mr. Rivers and Don Pedro?"</p>

<p>"Aye, mistress. The Governor was not
by,&mdash;'tis likely he knew naught of it."</p>

<p>"Not so!" I cried, "he had his share in the
quarrel, and they left the house in company."</p>

<p>"Mayhap," said Captain Baulk, "I'd not
gainsay it&mdash;for I trust no one o' them; but
he chose to go with his weather eye shut
rather than take precaution 'gainst the squall.
So they had it out all by their selves,&mdash;and
none of us a whit the wiser, saving young
Poole, who had guessed somewhat was amiss
and followed his master."</p>

<p>"What then? Speak quickly! Was Mr.
Rivers wounded?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not he! That's to say, not by any thrust
of the Don's. Lor', but it must ha' been a
pretty fight! Pity no man saw it that lives to
tell!"</p>

<p>"In the name of mercy, sir, speak plainly!"</p>

<p>"Aye, my young mistress, but give me time
an' I will. Mr. Rivers ere long did get in
such a thrust that the Don went down before
it as suddenly as a ship with all her hull stove
in. He lay stranded, with the blood flowing
away in a dark stream over the white sands.
Our young gentleman, gallant heart, did throw
away his sword and fall down beside the
Spaniard and strive to staunch his wounds,
crying aloud most lustily for aid. Who should
hear him but young Poole and that yellow
devil of a Tomas! They came from opposite
quarters, and Poole was in the shadow, so the
other saw him not. The mulatto ran up alongside,
and, seeing 'twas the Don who had fallen,
he whipped out a knife from his belt and
struck at our young master as he knelt there
on the ground. Nay, now, do not take on so!
Did I not say he was but little hurt? Had the
blow struck him fairly in the back, as it was
meant to do, doubtless it would have put an
end to him; but Poole was to the rescue,
poor lad! He threw himself on the mulatto
in the nick o' time. The knife had barely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
grazed Mr. Rivers on the shoulder; but young
Tomas never let go his hold of it. He and
the faithful lad rolled together on the ground&mdash;and
Poole never rose again. His body was
stabbed through in a dozen places. Mr.
Rivers had no time to interfere; ere he could
rise from his knees, or even put out a hand to
take his sword, a dozen soldiers had laid hands
on him. That devil of a Tomas finished his
evil work, and then picked himself up and
walked away; never a one laid a finger on
him or cried shame on the foul deed!"</p>

<p>The old sailor paused, and each man of the
group breathed a curse through his clinched
teeth.</p>

<p>"They have taken Mr. Rivers to the dungeon
of the fort?" I whispered.</p>

<p>"Aye, so they tell us. None of us were
there, which is perhaps for the good of our
necks,&mdash;yet I would we had had a chance to
strike a blow in defence of the poor lad."</p>

<p>"And the Spaniard&mdash;Don Pedro?"</p>

<p>"They carried him into the Governor's own
house a while since. I think his wound is
mortal."</p>

<p>"Then he has brought his death upon himself,
for he forced Mr. Rivers into the quarrel,"
I declared hastily.</p>

<p>"'Twas bound to come," admitted Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Baulk, "there has been bad blood between
them from the very first. But what are we to
do with you, mistress? Did they put you
out in anger?"</p>

<p>"Nay," I exclaimed, "I heard a great disturbance
and hastened out to seek the cause.
The outer door was left unbarred."</p>

<p>"Why then, mistress, we would best make
for it again before 'tis shut! This is no hour
and no place for a young maid to be out alone."
Taking me by the hand he led me back the
way I had come; but we were too late. The
entrance was closed and barred against us.</p>

<p>"Now, what's to do?" exclaimed the old
sailor in dismay.</p>

<p>I had been too crushed and dazed by the
ill news to think before of my imprudence;
but now I realized how very unwisely I had
acted. I turned hastily to the old captain.</p>

<p>"Go and leave me, my good friend," I said.
"Already there has been enough trouble of
my making. Do not let me have to answer
for more. I will wait here and call for some
one to open for me. 'Tis better for me to say
what is the truth&mdash;that I wandered out in my
anxiety. Go, I pray you, and be discrete in
your conduct, that they may have no just
cause to imprison you also."</p>

<p>He saw the wisdom of it and went away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
out of sight, while I beat with all my might
upon the door.</p>

<p>In a moment steps sounded within, the bars
fell, and the door was drawn back. It was
the Governor himself who stood there. He
looked at me in astonishment as he drew aside
for me to pass.</p>

<p>I attempted no explanation; for I knew he
could not understand me. Doubtless he
would tell his lady and she would hold me to
account. Slowly I mounted to the balcony
above and pushed open the door of my
chamber.</p>

<p>The dame still slept peacefully. I went
softly to the window and knelt down. My
heart was sick for the faithful lad who had
died in defending Mr. Rivers. Poor boy!
He had no mother&mdash;I wonder if there was a
little lass anywhere whom he loved? But no,
he was young for that. I think his love was all
his master's. And to die for those whom we
love best is not so sad a fate as to live for
their undoing!</p>

<p>The hot tears ran down my face. I leaned
my cheek against the bars and set free my
thoughts, which flew, as swift as homing
pigeons, to my dear love in his dungeon
cell.</p>

<p>Oh! I would that all the prayers I pray,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and all the tender thoughts I think of him,
had wings in very truth; and that after they
had flown heavenward they might bear
thence some balm, some essence of divinest
pity, to cheer him in his loneliness! If it were
so, then there would be in never-ending flight,
up from the barred window where I kneel, and
downward to the narrow slit in his prison wall,
two shining lines of fluttering white wings
coming and going all these long nights
through!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> days have passed since I began to
write these pages.</p>

<p>All the morning after that terrible night,
with Barbara I waited fearfully for some manifestation
of Do&ntilde;a Orosia's anger. But there
was none, nor were we summoned out that
day. Food was brought to us, and we remained
like prisoners in our chamber. Don
Pedro was very low, the servant told us, and
the Governor's lady was nursing him.</p>

<p>A week went by,&mdash;the longest week I had
ever known,&mdash;and then we heard that Melinza
would recover. However, it was not until he
had lain ill a fortnight that Do&ntilde;a Orosia came
to visit me.</p>

<p>I was sitting by the window with my head
upon my hand, and Barbara was putting some
stitches in the worn places in her gown, when
the door opened to admit my hostess.</p>

<p>She came straight toward me with a glint
of anger in her dark eyes. The long nights
of anxious watching had driven back the
blood from her smooth olive cheek, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
red lips showed the redder for her unaccustomed
pallor. She laid one hand on my head,
tilting it backward.</p>

<p>"You little white-faced fool! I would you
had never set foot in this town," she cried
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Ah! madame, I came not of my own free
will," I answered her. "I and my dear love
would willingly go hence, an you gave us the
means to do so!"</p>

<p>"'Tis likely that we shall, truly," she replied.
"'Tis likely that the Governor of San Augustin
will keep a galley to ply up and down the
coast for the convenience of you English intruders!
There came two more of you this
morning, from the friar at Santa Catalina."</p>

<p>"Two more English prisoners!" I exclaimed.
"Who are they, madame?"</p>

<p>"I know not, and I care not," she said. "I
meddle not with things that do not concern
me. I come here now but to hear how you
came to be on the streets at midnight. Had
I been in the Governor's place then, I would
have shut the door in your face."</p>

<p>I told her the truth, as it had happened to
me; and when she had heard it her brow lightened
somewhat.</p>

<p>"Are you deceiving me? You did not leave
here till <i>after</i> the duel had taken place?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madame," I said, "I have never yet told a
lie, and I would not now were it to save my
life."</p>

<p>Her lip curled slightly as she turned to go.
"Stir not from this room, then, until Don
Pedro is well enough to leave the house," she
said. "If I could prevent it he should never
look upon your face again." She paused an
instant, then added: "I <i>will</i> prevent it!"</p>

<p>"Amen to that!" I said, and I felt the blood
burn warmly in my cheek.</p>

<p>She turned and looked at me, and I met
her gaze with defiant eyes.</p>

<p>"Amen to that, madame!&mdash;for truly I hate
him with all my heart!"</p>

<p>She stood still, a slow crimson rising in her
pale face, and I trembled a little at my own
daring. Then, to my surprise, she laughed at
me.</p>

<p>"You think that you hate him desperately?"
she exclaimed. "Silly child, it is not in thy
power to hate that man as I do, as I have done
for years!" and with that she went away and
left me wondering.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">July</span>, the 16th day.</p>

<p>Two things have happened recently to break
the sad monotony of my life within these
walls.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Orosia and Melinza have had a disagreement,
which has resulted in his removal
hence&mdash;at his own demand. Although I know
nothing of the cause of their quarrel, Do&ntilde;a
Orosia's last words to me, the other day, make
it possible to understand the man's reluctance
to remain here in her care,&mdash;and yet they say
it was her nursing that saved his life! I would
that I could understand it all!</p>

<p>Since his departure I have had the freedom
of the courtyard and garden; and yesterday,
by good chance, I had speech with one of the
newly arrived English prisoners.</p>

<p>It had been a day of terrible heat, and just
at nightfall I wandered out into the garden
all alone. There is a high wall to it, which so
joins the dwelling that together they form a
hollow square. This wall is of soft gray stone;
it is of a good thickness, and about a man's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
height. Along the top of it sharp spikes are
set; and near one corner is a wrought-iron gate
of great strength, which is kept securely
locked.</p>

<p>It is not often that I venture near this gate,
for it looks out upon the street, and I care not
to be seen by any Indian or half-breed Spaniard
who might go loitering by; but as I stood
in the vine-covered arbour in the centre of the
garden I heard a man's voice from the direction
of the gate, humming a stave of a maritime
air that I had heard sung oft and again by
the sailors on the sloop, in which some unknown
fair one is ardently invited to&mdash;</p>

<p class="pub1">"&mdash;be the Captain's lady!"</p>

<p>and I knew it must be a friend. So I made
haste thither and peered out into the street.</p>

<p>Sure enough it was old Captain Baulk, and
with him a gentleman whose face, even in the
twilight, was well known to me,&mdash;he being
none other than Mr. John Collins of Barbadoes
(the same who had given us news of my poor
father's end, and one of our fellow passengers
on the <i>Three Brothers</i>).</p>

<p>They both greeted me most kindly and inquired
earnestly how I did and if I was well
treated. It seems that for days they had been
trying to get speech with me, but could find
none to deliver a message; so for two nights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
past they had hung about the gate, hoping
that by chance I might come out to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Collins related to me how the sloop had
been sent back to Santa Catalina with letters
to the friar and the Governor of San Augustin,
demanding our release on the ground that
as peace was now subsisting between the
crowns of England and of Spain, and no act
of hostility had been committed by us, our
capture was unwarrantable. But Padre Ignacio,
with his plausible tongue, had beguiled
them ashore into his power.</p>

<p>"The man is a very devil for fair words and
smooth deceits," declared Mr. Collins. "In
spite of all the warnings we had received, some
of us landed without first demanding hostages
of the Indians; and when we would have departed
two of us were forcibly detained on
pretence of our lacking proper credentials to
prove our honesty. In sooth he charged us
with piratical intentions, though we had not
so much as cracked a pistol or inveigled one
barbarian aboard. The sloop lingered for
three days, but finally made off, leaving us in
the hands of the padre. He despatched us
here in canoes, under a guard of some twenty
half-naked savages, with shaven crowns, who
are no more converted Christians than the
fiends in hell!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>I asked, then, for news of my uncle, Dr.
Scrivener, and Mr. Collins assured me that he
was most anxious for my safety, and would
have come back with them to demand us of
the friar, but he had received a hurt in the
neck during the attack at Santa Catalina and
was in no state to travel, although the wound
was healing well&mdash;for which God be thanked!</p>

<p>So far, all the prisoners, except Mr. Rivers,
have the freedom of the town; but Captain
Baulk declared he would as lief be confined
within the fort.</p>

<p>"There be scarce two honest men&mdash;saving
ourselves&mdash;in all San Augustin," he said.
"The lodging-house where we sleep is crowded
with dirty, thieving half-breeds, who would as
willingly slit a man's throat as a pig's. Though
they hold us as guests against our will, we
must e'en pay our own score; and some fine
night&mdash;you mark me!&mdash;we shall find ourselves
lacking our purses."</p>

<p>"Then the Governor will be at the cost of
our entertainment," said Mr. Collins.</p>

<p>"'Twill be prison fare, sir," grunted the old
sailor, "and we'll be lucky if he doesn't find it
cheaper to heave us overboard and be done
with it!"</p>

<p>"Tut! man,&mdash;hold your croaking tongue in
the poor young lady's presence," whispered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Mr. Collins; but I heard what he said, and bade
him tell us our true case and what real hope
there was of our liberation.</p>

<p>"There is every certainty," he said. "When
word reaches their Lordships in England, they
will not fail to make complaint to the Spanish
Council,&mdash;and they have no just cause for refusing
to set us free. But I trust we shall not
have to wait for that. If we had a Governor
of spirit, instead of a timorous old man like
Sayle, he would have already sent the frigate
down here to demand us of the Spaniards.
There are not lacking men to carry out the
enterprise: Captain Brayne could scarce be
restrained from swooping down on the whole
garrison&mdash;as Rob Searle did, not long ago,
when he rescued Dr. Woodward out of their
clutches."</p>

<p>"Captain Brayne!&mdash;the frigate! Do you
mean that the <i>Carolina</i> has arrived?"</p>

<p>"Two months ahead of our sloop," declared
Mr. Collins; "but Governor Sayle has despatched
her to Virginia for provisions, of which
we were beginning to run short. The <i>Port
Royal</i> has not been heard of, so 'tis feared she
went down in the storm."</p>

<p>He went on to tell me of the new settlement
which had been already laid out at a place
called Kiawah,&mdash;a very fair and fruitful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
country, which Heaven grant I may one day
see!</p>

<p>In my turn I related all that had befallen me
since we reached this place. They heard me
out very gravely, and promised to contrive
some means of communicating with me in case
of need.</p>

<p>Then, as it grew very late, we parted, promising
to meet the following night; and I crept
softly back to the house and my little room,
greatly comforted that I now had a worthy
gentleman like Mr. Collins with whom I could
advise; for with his knowledge of the Spanish
tongue and his sound judgment I hope he
may influence the Governor in our favour.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The sun is setting now, I think, although I
cannot see it from my window; for all the sky
without is faintly pink, and every ripple on
the bay turns a blushing cheek toward the
west. I must lay by my pen and watch for an
opportunity to keep tryst at the gateway with
my two good friends....</p>

<p>Nine of the clock.</p>

<p>God help me! I waited in the garden till I
heard a whistle, and stole down to the gate as
before.</p>

<p>A man put out his hand and caught at mine
through the bars. It was that vile Tomas&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
wretch who would have murdered my dear
love! I screamed and fled, but he called after
me in Spanish. The words were strange to me&mdash;but
the tones of his voice and the coarse
laughter needed no interpreter!</p>

<p>As I flew across the garden, too frightened
to attempt concealment, Do&ntilde;a Orosia stepped
out into the courtyard and demanded an explanation.
I knew not what to say, for I
could not divulge the motive that had sent me
out; but I told her that a man had called me
from the gate, and when I went near to see
who it might be I recognized the servant of
Melinza.</p>

<p>She seemed to doubt me at first, till I described
him closely; then she was greatly
angered and forbade me the garden altogether.</p>

<p>"If I find you here alone again," she hissed,
seizing my shoulder with no gentle grasp,
"if I find you here again, I will turn the key
upon you and keep you prisoner in your
chamber."</p>

<p>So now I dare not venture beyond the court
and the balconies; and there will be no chance
of speaking with Mr. Collins unless he dares
to come under my window, and there is little
hope of his doing that unseen, for 'tis in full
view from the ramparts of the fort, where a
sentry paces day and night.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">August</span>, the 7th day.</p>

<p>When I began this tale of our captivity it
was with the hope that I might find some
means of sending it to friends, in this country
or in England, who would interest themselves
in obtaining our release. However, from what
Mr. Collins told me, I feel assured that news
of Mr. Rivers's capture has already been sent
to their Lordships the proprietors, and this
record of mine seems now but wasted labour.
Yet from time to time, for my own solace, I
shall add to it; and perchance, some day in
safety and freedom, I and&mdash;&mdash;another&mdash;&mdash;may
together read its tear-stained pages.</p>

<p>This day I have completed the seventeenth
year of my age. It is a double anniversary, for
one year ago this night&mdash;it being the eve of our
departure from England&mdash;I first set eyes upon
my dear love.</p>

<p>Can it be possible that he, in his dolorous
prison, has taken account of the passing days
and remembers that night&mdash;a year ago?
'Twould be liker a man if he took no thought of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the date till it was past,&mdash;yet I do greatly wonder
if he has forgotten.</p>

<p>As for me, the memory has lived with me
all these hours since I unclosed my eyes at
dawn.</p>

<p>I can see now the brightly lighted cabin of
the <i>Carolina</i>, where the long supper-table
was laid for the many passengers who were to
set out on the morrow for a new world. I had
been somehow parted from my uncle, Dr. Scrivener,
and I stood in the cabin doorway half
afraid to venture in and meet the eyes of all
the strangers present. I felt the colour mounting
warmly in my cheek, and my feet were
very fain to run away, when Captain Henry
Brayne, the brave and cheery commander of the
frigate, caught sight of me, and, rising hastily,
led me to a seat at his own right hand.</p>

<p>(I do recollect that I wore a new gown of
fine blue cloth&mdash;a soft and tender colour, that
became me well.)</p>

<p>As I took my place I glanced shyly round,
and saw, at the farther end of the long table,
the gallantest gentleman I had ever set eyes
upon in all my sixteen years of life. He was
looking directly at me, and presently he lifted
his glass and said:</p>

<p>"Captain Brayne, I give you <i>the Carolina and
every treasure she contains</i>!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>There was some laughter as the toast was
drunk, and my uncle&mdash;who had only that
moment entered and taken his seat beside me&mdash;asked
of me an explanation.</p>

<p>"Nay, Dr. Scrivener," said the jovial captain,
"'tis not likely the little lady was attending.
But now I give you&mdash;<i>the health of Mistress Tudor!</i>
(and it will not be the first time it
has been proposed to-night!)"</p>

<p>And that was but a year ago. I would never
have guessed that at seventeen I could feel so
very old.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">San Augustin's Day</span>&mdash;August, the 28th.</p>

<p>Oh! but I have been angered this day!</p>

<p>What? when my betrothed lies in prison, ill,
perhaps, or fretting his brave heart away, am I
to be dragged forth to make part of a pageant
for the entertainment of his jailers? I would
sooner have the lowest cell in the dungeon&mdash;aye!
and starve and stifle for lack of food and
air, than be forced to deck myself out in borrowed
bravery, and sit mowing and smiling in
a gay pavilion, and clap hands in transport
over the fine cavalier airs of the man I hold
most in abhorrence!</p>

<p>Do they take me for so vapid a little fool
that I may be compelled to any course they
choose? Nay, then, they have learned a lesson.
Oh, but it is good to be in a fair rage for once!</p>

<p>I had grown so weary and sick at heart that
the blood crawled sluggishly in my veins; my
eyes were dull and heavy; I had sat listlessly,
with idle hands, day after day, waiting&mdash;waiting
for I knew not what! Therefore it was
that I had no will or courage to oppose the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Governor's wife when she came to me this
morning and bade me wear the gown she
brought, and pin a flower in my hair, and sit
with her in the Governor's pavilion to see the
fine parade go by.</p>

<p>"This is a great day in San Augustin," she
said, "being the one-hundred-and-fifth anniversary
of its founding by the Spanish."</p>

<p>As the captives of olden times made part
of the triumph of their conquerors, 'twas
very fit that I, forsooth, should lend what
little I possessed of youth and fairness to the
making of a Spanish holiday!</p>

<p>But I was too spiritless, then, to dare a refusal.
I bowed my head meekly enough while
Ch&eacute;pa&mdash;the smiling, good-natured negress&mdash;gathered
up the rustling folds of the green
silk petticoat and slipped it over my shoulders.
I made no demur while she looped and
twisted the long tresses of my yellow hair,
fastening it high with a tall comb, and tying
a knot of black velvet riband upon each of the
wilful little bunches of curls that ever come
tumbling about my ears.</p>

<p>When all was finished, and the lace mantilla
fastened to my comb and draped about my
shoulders, I was moved by Barbara's cries of
admiration to cast one glance upon the mirror.
'Twas an unfamiliar picture that I saw there,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and my pale face blushed with some mortification
that it should have lent itself so kindly to
a foreign fashion.</p>

<p>I would have thrown off all the braveries
that minute; but just then came a message
from Do&ntilde;a Orosia, bidding me hasten.</p>

<p>"What matters anything to me now?" I
thought wearily; and, slowly descending to
the courtyard, I took my place in the closed
chair that waited, and was borne after the
Governor's lady to the Plaza, where, at the
western end facing upon the little open square,
was the gay pavilion.</p>

<p>Its red and yellow banners shone gaudily in
the hot sunlight of the summer afternoon, and
the fresh sea breeze kept the tassels and
streamers all a-flutter, like butterflies hovering
over a bed of flowers.</p>

<p>Three sides of the Plaza were lined with
spectators, but the eastern end&mdash;which opened
out toward the bay&mdash;was kept clear for the
troops to enter.</p>

<p>Against the slight railing of the little pavilion
leaned Do&ntilde;a Orosia, strangely fair in a
gown of black lace and primrose yellow, that
transformed the soft contours of her throat
and cheek from pale olive to the purest pearl.
She deigned to bestow but a single cold, unfriendly
glance upon me; then she bent forward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
as before, her lifted fan shielding her
eyes from the glare of the sun-kissed sea.</p>

<p>Presently, with the blare of trumpets and
the deep rolling of the drums, the King's
troops came in sight, three hundred strong.</p>

<p>At the head of the little band, which
marched afoot, rode Melinza and the Governor.
'Twas the first time I had seen a horse
in the town.</p>

<p>Old Se&ntilde;or de Colis was mounted on a
handsome bay that pranced and curvetted
beneath him, to his most evident discomfort;
but Melinza's seat was superb. It was a dappled
gray he rode, with flowing mane and tail
of silvery white; a crimson rosette was fastened
to its crimped forelock, and the long
saddle-cloth was richly embroidered.</p>

<p>As the little company swept round the
square, the two horsemen saluted our pavilion.
Don Pedro lifted his plumed hat high, and I
saw that his face was pale from his recent
wound, but the bold black eyes were as bright
as ever they had been before.</p>

<p>I drew back hastily from the front of the
pavilion and made no pretence of returning
his salute. Then, for the first time since I
had taken my seat beside her, Do&ntilde;a Orosia
spoke to me.</p>

<p>"Why such scant courtesy?" she asked,
with lifted brows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madame," I answered, "had my betrothed
been here at my side, an honoured guest, I
would have had more graciousness at my command."</p>

<p>"What!" she exclaimed, "have you not
yet had time to forget your quarrelsome
cavalier?"</p>

<p>"I will forget him, madame, when I cease
to remember the treachery of those who
called themselves his entertainers."</p>

<p>She flushed angrily. "Your tongue has
more of spirit than your face. I wonder that
you have the courage to say this to me."</p>

<p>"I dare, because I have nothing more to
lose, madame!"</p>

<p>"Say you so? Would you rather I gave
you into Melinza's keeping?"</p>

<p>"Nay!" I cried, "you could not&mdash;such
unfaith would surpass the limits of even
Spanish treachery! And you would not&mdash;it
would please you better <i>if he never set eyes upon
my face again</i>! I only wonder that you should
have brought me here to-day!"</p>

<p>She opened her lips to speak; but the blare
of the trumpets drowned the words, and she
turned away from me.</p>

<p>The troops were drawn in line across the
square: on the right, the Spanish regulars of
the garrison; on the left, the militia companies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
which had come up while we were speaking.
These last were made up, for the most part, of
mulattoes and half-breed Indians,&mdash;a swarthy-faced,
ill-looking band that appeared fitter for
savage warfare of stealth and ambuscade and
poisoned arrows than for valorous exploits
and honest sword-play.</p>

<p>The various man&#339;uvres of the troops, under
the skilled leadership of Don Pedro, occupied
our attention for upward of an hour, during
all which time my companion appeared quite
unconscious of my presence. She sat motionless
save for the swaying of her fan. Only
once did her face express aught but fixed
attention&mdash;and that was when a sudden fanfare
of the trumpets caused the Governor's horse
to plunge, and the old man lurched forward
on the pommel of his saddle, his plumed hat
slipping down over his eyes.</p>

<p>For an instant the swaying fan was still;
a low laugh sounded in my ear, and, turning,
I saw the red lips of the Governor's lady take
on a very scornful curve.</p>

<p>She received him graciously enough, however,
when&mdash;the review being over&mdash;he dismounted
and joined us in the pavilion.</p>

<p>Melinza had retired with the troops; but
just as the last rank disappeared from view
he came galloping back at full speed, flung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
himself from the saddle, and, throwing the
reins to an attendant, mounted the pavilion
stair.</p>

<p>I felt that Do&ntilde;a Orosia's eyes were upon
me, and I believed that she liked me none the
less for my hostility to the man. It may
have been this that gave me courage&mdash;I do not
know&mdash;I think I would not have touched his
hand in any case.</p>

<p>He flushed deeply when I put both of mine
behind my back; then, with the utmost
effrontery, he leaned forward and plucked
away one little black rosette that had fallen
loose from my curls and was slipping down
upon my shoulder. This he raised to his lips
with a laugh, and then fastened upon his breast.</p>

<p>I was deeply angered, and I cast about for
some means of retaliation that would show
him the scorn I held him in.</p>

<p>At the foot of the pavilion stood the youth
who was holding Melinza's horse.</p>

<p>I leaned over the railing, and, loosing quickly
from my hair the fellow to the rosette Don
Pedro wore, I tossed it to the lad below,
saying, in almost the only Spanish words I
knew,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a gift!"</p>

<p>Melinza's face grew white with anger; he
tore off the bit of riband and ground it under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
his heel; then he strode down the stair,
mounted his horse, and rode away.</p>

<p>The Governor's lady watched him till he
was out of sight; then, with a strange smile,
she said to me,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I never knew before that blue eyes had so
much of fire in them. I think, my little saint,
'tis time I sent you back to your old duenna."</p>

<p>"I would thank you for so much grace!"
was my reply. And back to Barbara I was
despatched forthwith.</p>

<p>But though I have been some hours in my
chamber, my indignation has not cooled.
The very sight of that man's countenance is
more than I can endure!</p>

<p>I am resolved that I will never set foot outside
my door when there is any chance of my
encountering him, and so I shall inform the
Governor's wife when she returns....</p>

<p>She laughs at me! She declares I shall do
whatever is her pleasure! And what is my
puny strength to hers? With all the will in
the world to resist her, I am as wax in her
hands!</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first day of March.</p>

<p>For six months I have added nothing to
this record; though time and again I have
taken up my pen to write, and then laid it by,
with no mark upon the fresh page. Can heartache
be written down in words? Can loneliness
and longing,&mdash;the desolation of one
who has no human creature on whom to lavish
love and care,&mdash;the dull misery that is known
only to those whose best beloved are suffering
the worst woes of this woeful life,&mdash;can all
these be told? Ah, no! one can only feel
them&mdash;bear them&mdash;and be crushed by them.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the good old dame, I
know not what would have become of me.
Many a day and many a night I have clung
to her for hours, weeping&mdash;crying aloud, "I
cannot bear it! I cannot!" What choice had
I but to bear it? And tears cannot flow forever;
the calm of utter weariness succeeds.</p>

<p>'Tis not that I have been ill treated. I am
well housed, and daintily clothed and fed.
Unless Melinza&mdash;or some other guest&mdash;is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
present, I sit at the Governor's own table.
His wife makes of me something between a
companion and a plaything: one moment I
have to bear with her capricious kindness; the
next, I am teased or driven away from her
with as little courtesy as she shows to the
noble hound that follows her like her own
shadow.</p>

<p>Until lately I have seen little of Melinza.
Early in the winter he went away to the
Habana and remained absent two months,
during which time I had more peace of mind
than I have known since first we came here.
But since his return he has tried in various
ways to force himself into my presence; and
Do&ntilde;a Orosia,&mdash;who could so easily shield me
if she chose,&mdash;before she comes to my relief,
permits him to annoy me until I am roused to
the point of passionate repulse. One could
almost think she loves to see me suffer&mdash;unless
it is the sight of his discomfiture that affords
her such satisfaction.</p>

<p>But all of this I could endure if only my
dear love were free! I have heard that he is
ill. It may not be true,&mdash;God grant that it is
not! Still, though the rumour came to me
by devious ways, and through old Barbara's
lips at last (and she is ever prone to think the
worst), it is more than possible! I, myself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
have suffered somewhat from this long confinement;
and in how much worse case is he!</p>

<p>I have tried to occupy myself, that I may
keep my thoughts from dwelling forever on
our unhappy state. In the past six months I
have so far mastered the Spanish tongue that
now I can converse in it with more ease than
in the French. The Governor declares that I
have the true intonation; and even Do&ntilde;a
Orosia admits that I have shown some aptitude.
I care nothing for it as a mere accomplishment;
but I hope that the knowledge may be of use
if ever we attempt escape. (Though what
chance of escape is there when Mr. Rivers is
within stone walls and I have no means of
even holding converse with Mr. Collins?)</p>

<p>I have one other accomplishment that has
won me more favour with the Governor's wife
than aught else. She discovered, one day,
that I have some skill with the lute, and a
voice not lacking in sweetness; and now she
will have me sing to her by the hour until my
throat is weary and I have to plead for rest.</p>

<p>I had, recently, a conversation with her that
has haunted me every hour since; for it
showed me a side of her nature that I had not
seen before, and that leads me to think that
under her caprice and petulance there is a
deep purpose hidden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>I had exhausted my list of songs, and as
she still demanded more I bethought me of a
curious old ballad I had heard many years
ago. The air eluded me for some while; but
my fingers, straying over the strings, fell
suddenly into the plaintive melody; with it,
the words too came back to me.</p>

<p>"A melancholy air, yet with somewhat of a
pleasing sadness in its minor cadences," commented
Do&ntilde;a Orosia when I had ceased.
"Translate me the words, an your Spanish is
sufficient."</p>

<p>"That it is not, I fear," was my reply, "and
the task is beyond me for the further reason
that the song is not even English, but in a dialect
of the Scots. 'Tis only the plaint of a
poor lady whose mind seems to have gone
astray in her long waiting for a faithless
lover"&mdash;and I gave her the sense of the verses
as best I could.</p>

<p>"Nay," said the Spanish woman, with a
singular smile. "She hath more wit than you
credit her with. You mark me, the flood of a
woman's tears will bear a man further than a
mighty river, and her sighs waft him away
more speedily than the strongest gale. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
once he has gone, taking with him such a
memory of her, 'twould be far easier for her
to drink the ocean dry than to wile him home.
For let a man but suspect that a woman <i>could</i>
break her heart for him, and he&mdash;&mdash;is more
than content to let her do it!"</p>

<p>She paused; but I made no answer, having
none upon my tongue. Presently she added:
"When once a woman has the folly to plead
for herself, in that moment she murders Love;
and every tear she sheds thereafter becomes
another clod upon his grave. There remains
but one thing for her to do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Herself to die!" I murmured.</p>

<p>"Nay, child! To live and be revenged!"
She turned a flushed face toward me; and,
though the water stood in her eyes, they were
hard and angry. "To be revenged! To plot
and to scheme; to bide her time patiently; to
study his heart's desire, and to foster it; and
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then?" I questioned softly, with little
shivers of repulsion chilling me from head
to foot.</p>

<p>"<i>To rob him of it.</i>"</p>

<p>The words were spoken deliberately, in a
voice that was resonant and slow. 'Twas not
like the outburst of a moment's impulse&mdash;the
sudden jangling of a harpstring rudely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
touched; it was rather with the fateful emphasis
of a clock striking the hour, heralded by a
premonitory quiver&mdash;a gathering together of
inward forces that had waited through long
moments for this final utterance.</p>

<p>What manner of woman was this? I
caught my breath with a little shuddering
cry.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Orosia turned quickly.</p>

<p>"Go! Leave me!" she cried. "Do you
linger? Can I never be rid of you? Out of
my sight! I would have a moment's respite
from your great eyes and your white face.
Go!"</p>

<p>And I obeyed her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">March</span>, the 9th day.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Orosia sent for me at noon to-day.
There was news to tell, and she chose to be
the one to tell it.</p>

<p>I found her in her favourite seat,&mdash;a great
soft couch, covered with rich Moorish stuffs,
and placed under the shadow of the balcony
that overlooks the sunny garden. Up each of
the light pillars from which spring the graceful
arches that support this balcony climbs a
mass of blooming vines that weave their delicate
tendrils round the railing above and then
trail downward again in festoons of swaying
colour. Behind, in the luminous shadow, she
lay coiled and half asleep; with a large fan of
bronze turkey-feathers in one lazy hand, the
other teasing the tawny hound which was
stretched out at her feet.</p>

<p>She opened her great eyes as I came near.</p>

<p>"Ah! the little blue-eyed Margarita, the
little saint who frowns when men worship at
her shrine," she said slowly. "There is news
for you. The <i>Virgen de la Mar</i> arrived last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
night from Habana, bringing the commands
of the Council of Spain that the English
prisoners here detained be liberated forthwith.
For it seems that there has been presented to
the Council, through our ambassador to the
English Court, a memorial, which clearly
proves that these persons have given no provocation
to any subject of his Catholic Majesty,
Charles the Second of Spain, and are therefore
unlawfully imprisoned. How like you that?"
The waving fan was suddenly stilled, and the
brilliant eyes half veiled.</p>

<p>"Is this true?" I asked, for my heart misgave
me.</p>

<p>She laughed. "It is true that the <i>Virgen de
la Mar</i> has brought those orders to the Governor
of San Augustin&mdash;and that my husband
has received them."</p>

<p>"Will he obey them, se&ntilde;ora?"</p>

<p>"Will who obey them?" she asked; and
there was a gleam of white teeth under the red,
curling lip. "My husband, or the Governor
of San Augustin?"</p>

<p>"Are they not the same?"</p>

<p>"If you think so, little fool," she cried,
half rising from her couch; "if you think so
still, you would better go back to your chamber
and pray yourself and your lover out of
prison!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>I made no answer; I waited, without much
hope, for what she would say next. My heart
was very full, but I would not pleasure her by
weeping.</p>

<p>"Child," she continued, sinking back among
the cushions and speaking in a slow, impressive
manner, "there are <i>two</i> Governors in
San Augustin&mdash;and they take their commands
neither from the child-King, the Queen-mother,
nor any of the Spanish Council. My husband
is not one; he obeys them both by turns.
His Excellency Don Pedro Melinza decrees
that these orders from Spain shall be carried
out except in the case of one Se&ntilde;or Rivers,
who will be held here to answer for an unprovoked
assault on one of his Majesty's subjects,
whom he severely wounded; also for
inciting others of his fellow prisoners to break
their parole, and for various other offences
against the peace of this garrison,&mdash;all of which
charges Melinza will swear to be true."</p>

<p>"Is he so lost to honour? And will your
husband uphold him in the lie?"</p>

<p>"Hear me out," she continued in the same
tone. "Melinza also decides that these orders
do not include the English se&ntilde;orita, Do&ntilde;a
Margaret, whom he intends to detain here for&mdash;&mdash;for
reasons best known to himself; although
the other Governor of San Augustin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
decrees"&mdash;&mdash;she started up from her nest of
pillows and continued in a wholly different
tone: "<i>I</i> say&mdash;<i>I</i> say&mdash;that you shall quit this
place with the other prisoners, and my husband
dares not oppose me! I am sick of your
white face and your saintly blue eyes; I am
wearied to death of your company; but I
swear Melinza shall not have you! Therefore
go you must, and speedily."</p>

<p>"And leave my betrothed at Don Pedro's
mercy?"</p>

<p>"What is that to me? Let him rot in his
dungeon. I care not&mdash;so I am rid of your
white face."</p>

<p>She shut her eyes angrily and thrust out
her slippered foot at the sleeping hound. He
lifted his great head and yawned; then, gathering
up his huge bulk from the ground, he drew
closer to his mistress's side and sniffed the
air with solicitude, as though seeking a cause
for her displeasure. There was a dish of cakes
beside her, and she took one in her white fingers
and threw it to the dog. He let it fall to
the ground, and nosed it doubtfully, putting
forth an experimental tongue,&mdash;till, finding it
to his taste, he swallowed it at a gulp. His
mistress laughed, and tossed him another,
which disappeared in his great jaws. A third
met the same fate; but the fourth she extended<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
to him in her pink palm, and, as he would
have taken it she snatched the hand away.
Again and again the poor brute strove to seize
the proffered morsel, but each time it was
lifted out of his reach; till finally his lithe
body was launched upward, and he snapped
both the cake and the hand that teased him.</p>

<p>'Twas the merest scratch, and truly the dog
meant it not in anger; but on the instant
Do&ntilde;a Orosia flushed crimson to her very brow,
and, drawing up her silken skirt, she snatched
a jewelled dagger from her garter and plunged
it to the hilt in the poor beast's throat. The
red blood spouted, and the huge body dropped
in a tawny heap.</p>

<p>I rushed forward and lifted the great head;
but the eyes were glazed.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;ora!" I cried, "se&ntilde;ora! the poor brute
loved you!"</p>

<p>She spurned the limp body with a careless
foot, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"So did&mdash;once&mdash;the man who gave it
me."</p>

<p>Then she clapped her hands, and the negro
servant came and at her command dragged
away the carcass, wiped the bloody floor, and
brought a basin of clear water and a linen
cloth to bathe the scratch on her hand.
When he had gone she made me bind it up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
with her broidered kerchief and stamped her
foot because I drew the knot over-tight.</p>

<p>"Do&ntilde;a Orosia," I said, when I had done it
to her liking. "If all you care for, in this
other matter, is to get rid of my white face, I
pray you kill me with your dagger and ask
your lord to let my love go free."</p>

<p>She looked up curiously. "Would you die
for him?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Most willingly, an it please you to make
my death his ransom."</p>

<p>Still she gazed at me and seemed strangely
stirred. "Once I loved like that," she said
in musing tones. "I will tell thee a tale, child,
for I like not the reproach in those blue eyes.
Five years ago, when I was as young as
thou art now, I lived with my parents in
Valencia, where the flowers are even sweeter
and the skies bluer than here in sunny Florida.
I had a lover in those days, who followed me
like my shadow, and, in spite of my old duenna,
found many a moment to pour his passion in
my ears. He was a brave man and a handsome,
and he won my heart from me. Though
he had no great fortune I would have wed
him willingly and followed him over land and
sea. I never doubted him for a day; and
when he came to my father's house with an
old nobleman, his uncle and the head of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
family, I was well content; for my mother
told me they had asked for my hand and it
had been promised. But when my father
called me in at last to see my future husband,
it was the old man who met me with a simper
on his wrinkled face. I turned to the nephew;
but he was gazing out of the window&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off with a fierce laugh and then
added bitterly,&mdash;"And so I came to marry
my husband, the Governor of San Augustin!"</p>

<p>"The other was Don Pedro?"</p>

<p>"Has thy baby wit compassed that much?
Yes, the other was Melinza."</p>

<p>"But if you once loved him why should
there be hate between you now?"</p>

<p>"Why? thou little fool! Why?"&mdash;she put
out one hand and drew me closer, so that she
could look deep into my eyes. "Why does a
woman ever hate a man? Canst tell me
that?"</p>

<p>We gazed at each other so until I saw&mdash;I
scarce know what I saw! My head swam,
and of a sudden it came over me that when
the angels fell from heaven there must have
been an awful beauty in their eyes!</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I awoke</span> this morning with a sense of
horror haunting me,&mdash;and then I recalled the
scene of yesterday and the dumb appeal in
the eyes of the dying hound. The story the
Spanish woman had told me of her own past
pleaded nothing in excuse. Hatred and
cruelty seemed strange fruit for love to bear.</p>

<p>I thought of my own ill fortunes, and I said
within me: True Love sits at the door of the
heart to guard it from all evil passions. Loss
and Pain may enter in, and Sorrow bear them
company; but Revenge and Cruelty, Untruth,
and all their evil kin, must hide their shamed
faces and pass by!</p>

<p>Secure in the thought of the pure affection
that reigned in my own bosom, I went forth
and met Temptation, and straightway fell
from the high path in which I believed my
feet to be so surely fixed!</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Orosia seemed to be in a strangely
gentle mood.</p>

<p>"Child, how pale thy face is! Didst thou
not lie awake all night? Deny it not, 'tis writ
most plainly in the dark shadows round those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
great blue eyes. Come, rest here beside me"&mdash;and
she drew me down upon the couch and
slipped a soft pillow under my head.</p>

<p>I was fairly dumfounded at this unwonted
courtesy, and could find no words to meet it
with. But she appeared unconscious of my
silence and continued speaking.</p>

<p>"'Tis the thought of the English lover that
robs thee of sleep, Margarita mia! Thou
wouldst give thy very life to procure his freedom;
is it not so? Would any task be too
hard for thee with this end in view?"</p>

<p>I could not answer; I clasped my hands
and looked at her in silence.</p>

<p>"I thought as much," she said, smiling, and
laid a gentle finger on my cheek.</p>

<p>"Oh, se&ntilde;ora, you will aid me to save him!
You will plead with the Governor&mdash;you will
set him free?"</p>

<p>She drew back coldly. "You ask too
much. I have told you that there are two
Governors in San Augustin&mdash;I divide the
honours with Melinza; but I plead with him
for naught."</p>

<p>I turned away to hide the quivering of my
lip.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," she added more kindly.
"Between Pedro Melinza and Orosia de Colis
there is at present an armed peace; since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
each holds a hostage. Not that I care anything
for the Englishman, but my husband is
undesirous of defying the commands of the
Council. Although he bears no love to your
nation, he maintains that it is not the policy
of our government, at present, to ignore
openly the friendly relations that are supposed
to exist between the Crowns of England
and of Spain. It seems that the duplicate of
the Council's orders has been sent to the Governor
of your new settlement on this coast;
and if he sends hither to demand the delivery
of the prisoners, Se&ntilde;or de Colis would rather
choose to yield up all, than to risk a reprimand
from the authorities at home.</p>

<p>"Dost thou understand all this? Well, let
us now see the reverse of the picture.</p>

<p>"Melinza sets his own desires in the scale,
and they outweigh all politic scruples. He has
sworn that so long as I stand between him
and you, so long will Se&ntilde;or Rivers remain in
the castle dungeon,&mdash;unless Death steps kindly
in to set your lover free."</p>

<p>A little sob broke in my throat at these
cruel words. Do&ntilde;a Orosia laid her hand on
mine.</p>

<p>"Poor little one!" she said.</p>

<p>"You pity me, se&ntilde;ora! What is your pity
worth?" I demanded, forcing back the tears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have a way of escape to offer," she answered
softly.</p>

<p>"Escape for him? Or for me?"</p>

<p>"For both. Now listen! There is but one
way to relax Melinza's hold on Se&ntilde;or Rivers.
He would exchange him willingly for you."</p>

<p>"Better for us both to die!" I exclaimed
indignantly.</p>

<p>"I would sooner kill you with my own
hands than give you up to him," said Do&ntilde;a
Orosia, with a cold smile.</p>

<p>"Then what do you mean, se&ntilde;ora?"</p>

<p>"I mean, Margarita mia, that you should
feign a tenderness for him and let him think
that it is I who would keep two loving souls
apart."</p>

<p>"What! when I have shown him naught
but dislike in all these months? He could
never be so witless as to believe in such a
sudden transformation."</p>

<p>"Such is the vanity of man," said Do&ntilde;a
Orosia, "that he would find it easier to believe
that you had feigned hatred all this while
from fear of me, than to doubt that you had
eventually fallen a victim to his fascinations."</p>

<p>"What would it advantage me if I did deceive
him?"</p>

<p>"He would then cease to oppose the liberation
of all the other prisoners."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what of my fate, se&ntilde;ora?"</p>

<p>"Leave that in my hands, little one,&mdash;I am
not powerless. I give thee my word he shall
never have thee. At the last moment we
shall undeceive him"&mdash;and she laughed a
low laugh of triumph.</p>

<p>I glanced up quickly.</p>

<p>"So!" I exclaimed. "This will be your
revenge! And you would bribe me, with my
dear love's freedom, to act a part in it! To
lie for you; to play at love where I feel only
loathing; to sully my lips with feigned caresses;
and to make a mockery of the holiest
thing in life!"</p>

<p>"Is your Englishman not worth some sacrifice?"
she asked, with lifted brows.</p>

<p>What could I say? I left her. I hastened
to my little room, shut fast the door, and
bolted it on the inner side. Then I knelt at
the barred window and looked out at the sunlight
and the sea.</p>

<p>The blue waves danced happily, and the
fresh wind kissed the sparkling ripples till the
foam curled over them&mdash;as white lids droop
coyly over laughing eyes. Two snowy gulls
dipped and soared, flashing now against the
blue sky&mdash;now into the blue sea. I gazed at
their white wings&mdash;and thought of all the vain
prayers I had sent up to Heaven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>And then the dark hour of my life closed
down on me.</p>

<p>I bethought me of my father, that loyal
gentleman whose only fault was that he served
his Prince too well,&mdash;a Prince whose gratitude
had never prompted him to inquire concerning
that servant's fate, or to offer a word of
consolation to the wife who had lost her all.
I bethought me of my young mother, of her
white, tear-stained face, of the long hours she
had spent upon her knees, and how at last
she prayed: "Lord! only to know that he is
dead!"&mdash;yet she died ignorant.</p>

<p>Then did the devil come to me and whisper:
"Of what use is it to have patience and faith?
Does thy God bear thee in mind&mdash;or is his
memory like that of the Prince thy father
served? Dost thou still believe that He
doeth all things well, and is there still trust in
thy heart? Come, make friends of those
who would aid thee&mdash;never mind a little lie!
Wouldst be happy? Wouldst save thy dear
love? Then cease thy vain prayers and take
thy fate in thine own hands."</p>

<p>I rose up from my knees and looked out
again upon the laughing waters,&mdash;I would do
this evil thing that good might come. I
would act a lying part, and soil my soul, so
that I and my dear love might win freedom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and happiness. But I would pray no more&mdash;for
I could not ask God's blessing on a lie.</p>

<p>Then I went slowly back to where my
temptress waited.</p>

<p>"Do&ntilde;a Orosia," I said, "I take your offer.
I am young&mdash;I would be happy; and you&mdash;you
would be revenged! I am not the little
fool you think me: I know you too well to
believe that you would aid me out of love; I
laugh at your pity; but I trust your hate!"</p>

<p>"<i>Bueno</i>," she said. "It is enough. We
understand one another,&mdash;but I must teach
thee the part, or thou wilt fail."</p>

<p>"I am not so simple, se&ntilde;ora, I can feign
love&mdash;for love's sake."</p>

<p>"Yet I would have thee set round with
thorns, my sweet. The rose that is too easy
plucked is not worth wearing. And do thou
give only promises and never fulfil them,&mdash;I'd
baulk him of every kiss he thinks to win!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A day</span> went by, and though I had become
even letter-perfect in my new r&ocirc;le I had not
the chance to play it to my audience; but it
came at last.</p>

<p>It was in the long, dreamy hour of the early
afternoon, when sleep comes easiest. Do&ntilde;a
Orosia had ordered her couch to be placed in
the shadiest part of the breezy garden, close
against the gray stone wall. Designedly she
chose the corner nearest the iron gate,
through which we could command a portion
of the sunny street; and here she lay and
made me sing to her all the songs I knew, the
while she dozed and waked again, and whiles
teased her parrot into uttering discordant
cries until for very anger I would sing no
more.</p>

<p>Suddenly she laid aside her petulance, and
with a quick, imperious gesture bade me take
up the lute again; then, falling back among
her pillows, she closed her eyes and let her
bosom rise and fall with the gentle breathings
of a sleeping child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>I hesitated in some astonishment; but again
the sharp command hissed from her softly
parted lips,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sing, little fool!&mdash;Melinza passes!"</p>

<p>I touched the lute with shaking fingers and
lifted my trembling voice. The notes stuck
in my throat and came forth huskily at first;
but then I thought on my dear love in his
hateful prison, and I sung as I had never sung
before.</p>

<p>Above the gray wall I saw Don Pedro's
plumed hat passing by. He reached the gate
and halted, gazing in with eager eyes. His
quick glance compassed the green nook, passed
over the sleeping figure, and fixed itself upon
my face.</p>

<p>The song died away; I leaned forward,
smiling, and laid a warning finger on my lip.</p>

<p>He made me a bow so courtly that the
feather in his laced hat swept the ground.</p>

<p>"So, se&ntilde;orita, the caged bird can sing?"</p>

<p>"When her jailer wills it so, Don Pedro," I
said softly, and smiled&mdash;and sighed&mdash;and gave
a half-fearful glance over my shoulder; then
added, in a lower whisper: "And when she
wills otherwise, I must be silent."</p>

<p>"How, would she even keep a lock upon your
lips?"</p>

<p>"Upon my lips&mdash;and my eyes also. Indeed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
my very brows are under her jurisdiction, and
are oft constrained to frown, against their
will!"</p>

<p>"So!" he exclaimed; and I saw a sweet
doubt creep over his face. "Must I place to
her account the many frowns you have bestowed
on me?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si, se&ntilde;or</i>&mdash;and add to those some others
that would not be coerced."</p>

<p>The fire in his black eyes frightened me
not a little as he whispered:</p>

<p>"If that be true, then grant me the rose in
your bosom, lady!"</p>

<p>I lifted a trembling hand to the flower, and
shot a frightened glance at the se&ntilde;ora's quivering
lashes.</p>

<p>"Oh! I dare not!" I murmured, and let my
hand fall against the lute upon my knee. The
jangling strings roused the pretended sleeper
from her dreams.</p>

<p>She half rose, and, seizing a pillow from her
couch, hurled it at me, saying angrily: "Here
is for such awkwardness!"</p>

<p>The soft missile failed of its proper mark;
but found another in the green parrot, who
was dangling, head downward, from his perch;
and there was an angry squawk from the
insulted bird.</p>

<p>I threw a timorous glance toward the gateway,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
motioning the intruder away. He would
have lingered, being to all appearances greatly
angered at the discourteous treatment of my
lady warder; but prudence prevailed, and he
fell back out of sight, with a hand upon his
heart, protesting dumbly.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The comedy had just begun. Now it
must be played through to the end.</p>

<p>It is a strange thing to see the zest with
which my gentle jailer prepares, each day, an
ambush for the unwary foe, and how he always
falls into the trap&mdash;to be assailed by me with
smiles, and soft complaints, piteous appeals
for sympathy, and shy admissions of my tender
friendship; which are always cut short by some
well-contrived interruption or the sudden
appearance of Do&ntilde;a Orosia on the scene.
Though only a week has passed, already Don
Pedro would take oath that I love him well.</p>

<p>Early this morning I heard him underneath
my window; and I was right glad of the chance
to smile on him from behind the protecting
bars. This meeting had not been of Do&ntilde;a
Orosia's contriving, so I thought I would use it
for my own ends.</p>

<p>I vowed to him that I was unhappy&mdash;which
was true. I protested that I was sick with longing
for freedom&mdash;and that, too, was no lie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
But to that I added a whole tissue of falsehood,
declaring that I had never drawn a free breath
since I came into the world; that my uncle had
been a tyrant, and the man to whom he had
betrothed me was jealous and exacting; that I
had been brought across the seas against my
will; and that I dreaded the hardships of life
in this new country. I said I had no wish to
rejoin the English settlers, and I denied, with
tears, any partiality for my dear love. Heaven
forgive me! but I professed I loved Don Pedro
better than any man I had ever seen, and I
entreated him to take me away from these barbarous
shores.</p>

<p>I had not thought that I could move him,
yet, strange to say, the man seemed touched.
I wondered as I listened to him, for I had
thought him all bad, and deemed his passion
but a passing fancy. He was speaking now of
Habana, a city of some refinement, where, as
his wife, I would enjoy the companionship of
other ladies of my own station.</p>

<p>"I'd never suffer thee to live here, my fairest
lady, where yon dark devil of a woman
could vent her spite on thee!" he whispered
softly; and my conscience smote me, for I was
playing with a man's heart, of flesh and blood.</p>

<p>But I bethought me, if there was in truth
any good in that heart, I would dare appeal to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
it; for I mistrusted that at any time Do&ntilde;a
Orosia would break her promised word.</p>

<p>"Truly, Don Pedro, I would go gladly, for
I hate the very sight of these walls; but&mdash;if
you love me&mdash;I would crave of your graciousness
another boon. Set free the English gentleman
who was my promised husband, and
send him, with the other prisoners, back to his
friends."</p>

<p>There was no answer, and I feared I had
overstepped the mark; but I dared further.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;or de Melinza," I said, "it is true that
I come of a race for which you have no love,
and that I hold a creed which you condemn;
nevertheless it must be remembered that we
have our own code of chivalry, and there
have lived and died in England as brave knights
and true as even your valiant Cid. I would
not have the man I am to wed guilty of an
unknightly act. Therefore be generous. You
have been mutually wounded; but it was in
fair duello,"&mdash;this I said feigning ignorance of
the coward blow that so nearly reached my
dear love's heart,&mdash;"and now, Don Pedro, it
would be the more honourable to set free the
countryman of your promised bride and send
him in safety to his friends."</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;orita," said the Spaniard,&mdash;and there
was a cloud upon his brow,&mdash;"I would you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
had asked me any boon but this. Nevertheless
I give you my knightly word that the
man shall go, and go unharmed."</p>

<p>"I thank you, Don Pedro," I said, and
fought down the cry of joy that struggled to
my lips. Then, because I could find no other
words, and feared to fail in the part I had to
play, I took Dame Barbara's scissors and cut
off a long lock of my yellow hair, bound it
with riband, and threw it down to him as guerdon
for the favour he had granted me.</p>

<p>This noon, when I joined the Governor's
wife as usual under the vine-hung balcony, I
boasted cheerfully of the promise I had wrung
from Melinza; and she demanded at once to
hear all that had passed between us,&mdash;then
called me a fool for my pains!</p>

<p>"Little marplot! Had you shown less concern
for the fate of your Englishman, it would
have been vastly better. You do but cast obstacles
in my way. There is nothing for me
to do now but hotly to oppose his leaving!
If needs must I will pretend a liking for the
man myself, and vow to hold him as my guest
yet a while longer, for the sake of his pretty
wit and his gallant bearing,&mdash;any device to
throw dust in their eyes, so that we seem not
to be of the same minds and putting up the
selfsame plea. Oh! little saint with the blue
eyes, your <i>m&eacute;tier</i> is not diplomacy!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"In sooth, se&ntilde;ora, till you first taught me
to dissemble I was unlessoned in the art."</p>

<p>She laughed then, and said that when I had
less faith in others I could more easily deceive.</p>

<p>"If the little Margarita believed Melinza's
pretty fable about Habana, and the excellent
company there which his <i>wife</i> would enjoy,
'tis no wonder that she made a tangle of her
own little web."</p>

<p>"But Do&ntilde;a Orosia, think you he would deal
unfairly with me? His words rang so true&mdash;even
a bad man may love honestly! And if
I trifle with the one saving virtue in his heart,
will it not be a grievous sin?"</p>

<p>The mocking smile died out of the Spaniard's
eyes and left them fathomless and sombre.</p>

<p>I felt as one who&mdash;looking into an open
window, and seeing the light of a taper glancing
and flickering within&mdash;draws back abashed,
when suddenly the flame is quenched, and only
the hollow dark stares back at his blinded
gaze.</p>

<p>"If he loves you," she said slowly, "it is
but as he has loved before, more times than
one. He would skim the cream of passion,
brush the dew from the flower, crush the first
sweetness from the myrtle-blooms,&mdash;and leave
the rest. You child, what do you know of
men? It is only the unattainable that is worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
striving for. There is much of the brute
beast in their passions. Did you mark, the
other day, how the dead hound turned a scornful
nozzle to the first sweet morsel that I pressed
on his acceptance? But afterward, the
fear of losing it made him eager to the leaping-point.
Just so I shall trick his master&mdash;shall
let him see thee, <i>almost</i> grasp and taste; then,
when the moment of mad longing comes, I'll
stab him with the final loss of thee! Only so
can I arouse a desire that will outlive a day;
for I know men's hearts to the core, thou blue-eyed
babe!"</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;ora," I cried, stung by her scornful
words, "I cannot say I know men's hearts;
but I do know the heart of one true gentleman;
and I believe, when he had won from
me the betrothal kiss, I was not less desirable
in his eyes!"</p>

<p>"So you believe," she said, and shook her
head. "<i>Bueno</i>, go on believing&mdash;while you
can. Woman's faith in man's fealty lives just
so long&mdash;&mdash;" and she bent forward from her
couch, plucked a fragile blossom from the
swaying vines, and cast it under foot.</p>

<p>I would have spoken again of my trust in
the leal true heart that trusted me; but
I saw the trembling of the laces on her bosom, I
saw the dark eyes growing more angerful, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a slow crimson rising in the rich cheek. She
was always "studying her revenge,"&mdash;this
beautiful, unhappy woman, "keeping her
wounds green which otherwise might heal and
do well."</p>

<p>As I watched her a great pity overcame me,
so that I held my peace.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> 20th of March&mdash;a day never to be forgot!</p>

<p>I have seen Mr. Rivers. It is the first time
since that night&mdash;nine months ago. I have
seen him and spoken with him in the presence
of Melinza, Do&ntilde;a Orosia, and the Governor.</p>

<p>Whatever may befall us now, nothing can
take away the memory of this last hour. If
ever we leave these walls together and taste
freedom again, it will have been dearly bought.
A maid's truth tarnished, and the brave heart
of a most loyal gentleman robbed of its faith!
Dear God, what a price to pay!</p>

<p>'Twas noon when Do&ntilde;a Orosia came herself
to fetch me.</p>

<p>"There is some deviltry afoot," she said.
"I cannot fathom it as yet; but, as you hope
for freedom for yourself and your Englishman,
don't fail to play your part to the end. Come
quickly! Melinza demands to see you, and
the Governor permits it. Don't blame me,
child&mdash;I can do nothing to prevent it. But,
I warn you, act the part, whatever it may cost
you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>I followed her, as in a dream, along the corridor,
into the room where the old Governor
sat in his arm-chair beside a carved table,
whereon were a decanter of wine, glasses half
drained, and a litter of playing-cards. He
drummed upon the table with his withered fingers,
and looked uneasily, first at his wife's
flushed face as she entered the door, and then
at the determined countenance of Melinza,
who was standing before the heavy arras which
divided that room from another in the rear.</p>

<p>"Do&ntilde;a Margarita," said the Governor, clearing
his throat nervously, "is it so that you are
detained within my house against your will?"</p>

<p>"Your Excellency," I began, and was thankful
I could speak truth, "I, and all the other
English, have been held here in San Augustin
for many a long month against our will."</p>

<p>"Without the orders of the Spanish Council
I could not liberate you, se&ntilde;orita; though now
we purpose to do so, having authority. But
concerning yourself&mdash;Melinza assures me that
you do not desire to be sent with your countrymen."</p>

<p>I felt my heart grow cold. Must I still cling
to the lie? I looked at Do&ntilde;a Orosia, whose
black eyes flashed a warning.</p>

<p>"That is true, Se&ntilde;or de Colis," I said, and
my voice sounded far off and strange.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would wish to remain here as my
guest and companion, Margarita," said the
Governor's wife in vehement tones.</p>

<p>I looked at her in wonder. What did they
desire between them? My head swam, and I
would have said Yes to her also; but her black
eyes menaced me again. I drew a deep breath
and shook my head. "No, please your Excellency."</p>

<p>Melinza smiled a slow triumphant smile.
"Do&ntilde;a Orosia is unfortunate. I trust I shall
be more successful. You would rather go to
Habana as <i>my</i> companion,&mdash;is it not so, Margarita
mia?"&mdash;and he stepped forward and
held forth his hand to me.</p>

<p>One day in the early spring Do&ntilde;a Orosia
had called me to see a new pet which had been
brought to her, a young crocodile, loathsome
and hideous; and she had forced me to touch
the tethered monster as it crawled, the length
of its chain, over the floor. I do remember
the cold disgust I felt at the horrid contact;
but it was as naught to the feeling that passed
over me when I let the Spaniard take my hand.</p>

<p>He drew me toward him, laughing softly.
"Who doubts that the lady goes willingly?"
and lifted his voice with a defiant question in
its ringing tones.</p>

<p>"I do, se&ntilde;or!"&mdash;and it was my dear love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
who pushed aside the arras and came forward
into the room,&mdash;my dear love, wasted by fever
and long imprisonment, white and gaunt and
spectral, yet bearing himself with all his olden
dignity.</p>

<p>The Spaniard turned to meet him, holding
me still within the circle of his arm. I gave
one final glance at the Governor's wife and
read my cue. After that I could see nothing
but my love's white face.</p>

<p>"Have I lied to you, Se&ntilde;or Englishman?
Do you believe, now, that I hold that golden
tress as a pledge of future favours? The lady
on whose faith you were ready to stake your
soul is here to answer for herself, and she has
thrown in her lot with me&mdash;with me, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p>"Margaret&mdash;Margaret!" cried my dear love,
"tell him he lies, sweetheart!"</p>

<p>I opened my lips, but the words died on my
tongue. Again my poor love cried to me,
holding out his arms. I saw his white
face grow paler still, and he swayed uncertainly
where he stood. Then, gathering all his
strength, he threw himself upon the Spaniard
and would have torn us apart, had not his
weak limbs given way, so that he fell prone
upon the floor.</p>

<p>Melinza's hand went to his sword; he drew
the blade and held it to my dear love's throat.</p>

"SPARE THE MAN, DON PEDRO! I LIKE NOT THE
SIGHT OF BLOOD."&mdash;<i>Page 125.</i></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>At last my voice came back to me; I laid
my hand upon the Spaniard's arm. "Spare
the man, Don Pedro! I like not the sight of
blood!"</p>

<p>Then I saw mortal agony in a brave man's
eyes. He made no move to rise, but lay there
at my feet and looked at me.</p>

<p>"Margaret Tudor," he said, "do you love
me still?"</p>

<p>I looked down at him. If I spoke truth,
Melinza's blade would soon cut short his hearing
of it. A wild laugh rose in my throat; I
could not hold it back, and it rang out, merrily
mad, in the silent room.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;ores," I said, "Se&ntilde;ores, I love a brave
man, not a coward!" and that was truth,
though none in that room read me aright, save
Do&ntilde;a Orosia.</p>

<p>The man at my side laughed with me, and
he at my feet gave me one look and swooned
away.</p>

<p>Melinza sheathed his sword, saying, "Your
Excellency, the prisoner appears convinced;
so you can scarce doubt the evidence yourself."</p>

<p>The Governor cleared his throat again, and
glanced helplessly toward his wife. She
stepped forward with scornful composure and
took my arm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Things are come to a pretty pass, Se&ntilde;or
de Colis, when Don Pedro brings his prisoners
under this roof and your wife is made a witness
to a brawl. I crave your leave to withdraw;
and I take this girl with me till the
question of her guardianship is settled."
Then, still holding me by the arm, she left the
room; and neither of the two men ventured
to stop our progress.</p>

<p>Arrived at my chamber Do&ntilde;a Orosia opened
the door and thrust me in, bidding me draw the
bolt securely.</p>

<p>I was left alone with my thoughts. Such
thoughts as they are! I cannot weep; my
eyes are hot and dry. There is no grief like
unto this. Oh, my mother! when your beloved
clasped you to his heart in that last
farewell, there were between you thoughts of
parting, of bodily pains to be borne, of scourgings
and fetters,&mdash;aye, and of death. But
what were those compared with what I have to
bear, who am humbled in the sight of my dear
love?</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> writing these words I cast aside my
pen, and, throwing myself upon the bed,
buried my face in the pillow. I could feel the
drumming pulses in my ears, and my heart
swelled till it was like to burst within my
bosom. Though I pressed my hot fingers
against my close-shut eyes, I still could see
my poor love's white, set face, the great hollows
in his bearded cheeks, the blue veins on
his thin temples, and the large eyes, one moment
all love-lighted, the next, stricken with
horror at the sight of my unfaith.</p>

<p>How long I lay there I can scarcely tell. It
was many hours after noon when I heard
heavy steps without my door, which suddenly
began to shake as though one beat upon it
with frantic hands.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" I cried, lifting my head.</p>

<p>"Oh! Mistress Margaret! a God's mercy&mdash;undo
the door!"</p>

<p>I drew the bolt in haste, and Dame Barbara
burst in and dropped down, weeping, at my
feet.</p>

<p>"Lord love ye, Mistress Margaret! Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
help us both this day! They have sent off all
our men to meet the blessed English ship&mdash;and
we two poor women left behind!"</p>

<p>I could not think it true. I seized the weeping
dame by her heaving shoulders and fairly
dragged her to her feet, demanding what proof
she had that this was so. She pointed dumbly
to the window, and fell a-sobbing louder than
before.</p>

<p>Then I looked out.</p>

<p>The <i>Carolina</i> frigate stood off the bar of
Matanzas Bay, and over the waves, in the direction
of the frigate, went a small boat impelled
by the brawny arms of six swarthy Spaniards.
With them were the English prisoners: I saw
the honest face of Captain Baulk, and next
him worthy Master Collins; also the three seamen
of the Barbadian sloop; and another,
whom I did not know, but guessed to be the
second of the two unlucky messengers; and&mdash;in
the midst of all&mdash;my dear love.</p>

<p>He lay full length, his white face resting
against the good captain's knees; and my
first thought was one of terror lest he was
dead: but I saw him lift himself, and give one
long look at the castle walls, then fall back
as before&mdash;and I knew, in that moment, he
put me from his heart for ever.</p>

<p>They were gone, all gone. Do&ntilde;a Orosia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
had played me false&mdash;God had turned His face
from me&mdash;and the man I loved would never
love me more.</p>

<p>I turned away from the window to the
weeping dame, and I laughed, laughed again
as I had done in the face of my dear love
that very morn.</p>

<p>"The piece is near ended, dame," I said.
"'Tis almost time to pray <i>God save His
Majesty</i> and draw the curtain. But what
strange tricks does Fate play sometimes with
her helpless puppets! She did cast us, long
ago, for a lightsome comedy, and lo! 'tis
to be a tragedy instead! Think you, dear
Barbara, that death would come easier by
means of yonder bed-cord, or of those great
scissors dangling at thy waist? Or, perhaps,
if thou couldst play Othello to my Desdemona,
it might seem a gentler prelude to the grave.
How heavy is a lie, good dame? Think you
it would drag a soul to hell? If so, I need not
to go alone; for if I lied to Melinza, he also
lied to me&mdash;and Do&ntilde;a Orosia also"&mdash;then a
strong shudder shook my frame. "Barbara,
Barbara, must I e'en have their company for
all eternity?"</p>

<p>She ran to me, good soul, and hushed me
like a child to her ample bosom.</p>

<p>"Lord help ye, dear lamb! And He will&mdash;He will!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
I heard her say over and over; then
everything turned dark before my eyes, and I
thought death had come to me indeed.</p>

<p>When consciousness returned I lay upon
my bed in a gray twilight, and beside me were
Dame Barbara and the Governor's wife.</p>

<p>As my eyes fell upon Do&ntilde;a Orosia, I cried
out bitterly that I had been a fool to trust
even to her hate; for now she had grown
weary of her revenge, and would discard her
tool without paying the price for it.</p>

<p>She covered my mouth with her hand,
laughing shortly.</p>

<p>"Melinza thinks he has been too sharp for
me. He despatched the prisoners in great
haste to the English ship without my knowledge.
I went to him just now and demanded
to know if he dared to send away Se&ntilde;or Rivers
without leave from me.</p>

<p>"'Aye,' he said, and bowed to me. 'Since
Do&ntilde;a Orosia desired for some reason to detain
him here, I thought it best to be rid of him at
once; but the girl remains.'</p>

<p>"'The girl remains in my guardianship,'
said I.</p>

<p>"'Until to-morrow,' Melinza answered.
'To-morrow the <i>Virgen de la Mar</i> returns to
Habana, and with her go the English girl and
your humble servant.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The Governor,' I cried, 'will not permit
it!'</p>

<p>"'Will he not? Ask him,' said Melinza,
'ask his Excellency the Governor of San Augustin!'
Then he laughed at me&mdash;<i>Dios!</i> he
laughed at me!"</p>

<p>She bit her red lip at the remembrance, and
clenched her white hands.</p>

<p>"And did you ask the Governor, se&ntilde;ora?"</p>

<p>She nodded fiercely. "The old dotard!
He did but shrug his shoulders and offer me a
diamond necklace in exchange for my pretty
puppet of a plaything. It is plain Melinza
has some hold upon him, what it is I cannot
guess; but it is stronger than my wishes. He
would sooner brave my anger than oppose his
nephew's schemes."</p>

<p>I watched the dark shadow settling on her
brow, and I thought all hope was over.</p>

<p>"Do&ntilde;a Orosia," I said at last, "will you
lend me your dagger?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, child&mdash;not unless there is no
other way to thwart them both. Look&mdash;"
she said, and threw a purse of gold pieces on
the bed beside me. "This is your purchase
money, and 'twill serve to buy assistance.
When I could make no better terms, I was
forced to take this and a kiss to boot&mdash;Pah!"
and she rubbed her cheek. "To-morrow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
when the tide is full, the <i>Virgen de la Mar</i>
will leave the harbour. Before then I must
contrive your escape."</p>

<p>"And Barbara's," I added, for I could see
the poor dame was in deep anxiety.</p>

<p>Do&ntilde;a Orosia stared. "Upon my soul, we
had all forgotten the old woman. She might
have gone well enough with the other prisoners;
but how am I to smuggle <i>two</i> women from
the town?"</p>

<p>Then I besought her not to separate me
from the dame, to whom I clung as my last
friend; and after a time she yielded me a
grudging promise and left me, bidding me
make ready for the evening meal, at which I
must appear in order not to arouse the Governor's
suspicions.</p>

<p>My hands were cold and trembling; but
with Barbara's aid I decked me out in one of
the gay gowns which had been given me by
my protectress, and, taking up a fan&mdash;with
which I had learned the Spanish trick of
screening my face upon occasion&mdash;I joined the
Governor and his beautiful spouse in the
brightly lighted <i>comedor</i>, where covers at table
were laid for three. I was thankful for Melinza's
absence, for to play at love-making that
night would have been beyond my powers.</p>

<p>At first I could eat nothing; but an urgent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
glance from Do&ntilde;a Orosia, and the thought of
what need there would be for all my strength
prompted me to force some morsels, in spite
of the convulsive swelling of my throat. I
made shift, also, to answer when addressed by
either host or hostess; but the Governor was
in no great spirits himself and seemed to
stand in some awe of his lady's frown.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without the door, sounded voices
in altercation, and a servant entered, protesting
with many apologies that there was a
reverend father without who demanded to see
his Excellency at once on a matter that would
brook no delay.</p>

<p>The Governor leaned back in his chair with
an air of great annoyance; but Do&ntilde;a Orosia
said quickly, "Bid the father enter."</p>

<p>A tall form in a friar's dark habit appeared
on the threshold. I recognized, under the
cowl, the thin, sallow face and the sombre
eyes. I had seen them at the door of the
chapel in the castle courtyard on the night
of our arrival, and many times since. They
belonged to Padre Felipe, the confessor of the
Governor's wife, and her adviser, I believed, in
affairs temporal as well as spiritual. Something
told me he had come hither at her bidding,
and I glanced at her for confirmation;
but Do&ntilde;a Orosia leaned with one elbow on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
table, her chin upon her white hand, the other
rounded arm outstretched with an almond in
the slim fingers for the delectation of the
green parrot on his perch beside her. Not a
flicker of interest was visible on her beautiful,
sullen face; so I turned away with some disappointment
to hear what the padre was saying.</p>

<p>His voice was low-pitched and husky, and I
could scarce distinguish what he said, save
that it concerned someone who was ill&mdash;nay,
<i>dead</i>, it seemed, and needing instant burial.</p>

<p>The Governor listened with a gathering
scowl upon his face, till suddenly he started
up with such haste that his chair fell backward
with a noisy clatter.</p>

<p>"<i>Santa Maria!</i> Dead of the black vomit?
And you come hither with the vile contagion
clinging to your very garments!"</p>

<p>"Nay," said the friar's deep, hollow voice,
as he lifted a reassuring hand. "I have
changed my robes. You and yours are in no
danger, my son."</p>

<p>"In no danger!" repeated the Governor, his
face becoming purple and his voice choked;
"no danger, when the foul carcass lies unburied,
tainting the very air with death!
Throw it over in the sea&mdash;nay, set fire to the
miserable hut in which it lies, and let all be
consumed together!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is it that is dead?" asked Do&ntilde;a Orosia.
She had risen, and stood with one hand
holding back her skirts, her full, red upper lip
slightly drawn, and her delicate nostrils dilated,
as though the very mention of the loathed disease
filled her with disgust.</p>

<p>"A wretched half-breed boy, some thieving
member of the padre's flock," exclaimed the
Governor impatiently. "Set fire to the hut,
I say!"</p>

<p>But Do&ntilde;a Orosia interrupted once again.
"Padre, what is it that you desire?"</p>

<p>The sombre eyes were turned on her for the
first time. "The boy was a Christian, my
daughter, and I would give him Christian
burial."</p>

<p>"Surely," said Do&ntilde;a Orosia. "What is to
prevent?"</p>

<p>"Would you spread the infection through
the town?" exclaimed the Governor, white
with fear.</p>

<p>"Nay," said the friar, "I ask but a permit
to take the body without the gates. None
but I and a few of my followers need be
exposed to danger. Let a bell be rung
before us, to warn all in the streets to stand
away; and we will carry a vessel of strong
incense before the bier. Those who go out
with me, I pledge you my word, shall not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
return for some days till they are free of all
taint themselves."</p>

<p>"My plan is better,&mdash;to burn hut, corpse,
and all," replied the Governor. But Padre
Felipe turned on him fiercely.</p>

<p>"How shall I keep my hold upon my people,
and they retain their faith in consecrated
things, if you treat a Christian's body as you
would the carcass of a dog?"</p>

<p>"As you will," the Governor exclaimed;
and, throwing himself into a chair, he called
for pen and paper. "Here," he added presently,
"deliver this to Don Pedro de Melinza,
and bid him warn the sentries at the gate.
Say, furthermore, that if any one in the town
comes within twenty paces of the bier, out of
the gate he shall go also."</p>

<p>The friar received the permit silently, lifted
his hand in benediction, and left the apartment.</p>

<p>As my glance returned from the doorway
it met that of Do&ntilde;a Orosia, and in hers there
was a passing flash of triumph. Soon after,
she rose, and together we withdrew. I felt
her hand upon my arm tighten convulsively;
but I walked on with the same sense of unreality
that had oppressed me all the day.</p>

<p>When we reached my chamber she bade
me change my dress again for something dark<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and warm; for the night air was damp and
chill. As I did so I slipped within my
bosom the roll of closely written pages containing
these annals of my prisonment. Then
I asked for Barbara, and Do&ntilde;a Orosia quietly
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"She has gone upon an errand and will
join us in due time." Then she threw a
mantle over my head, wrapped herself in
another, and led me out into the garden.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a moonless night, and a haze of cloud
obscured the stars. We passed silently under
the vine-covered arbour, across the garden, to
the gateway. Into the heavy lock Do&ntilde;a
Orosia slipped a great key; it turned easily,
the door swung open, and we stepped out.
Locking it once more, my companion took
my arm and hurried me along the dark, deserted
street. We turned a corner, came upon
an open square, and paused beside a huge
palmetto that grew near the centre. I heard
the crisp rustle of its leaves in the night wind,
and I shivered with a nameless dread.</p>

<p>Then, through the darkness, two dim forms
approached us. My heart beat quickly, and I
drew the mantle closer round my face; but
one of them proved to be the friar, the other,
my dear, dear Barbara. I sprang to meet her
with a quick cry; but Do&ntilde;a Orosia laid a
hand upon my lips and hurried me on. Padre
Felipe now led the way, and we followed him
for some moments more until he paused before
a low doorway and motioned us to enter.</p>

<p>"Se&ntilde;ora," I whispered, "why do you come?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
I have no fear of the disease, but why should
you needlessly expose yourself?"</p>

<p>"Little fool," she answered, pushing me
gently on, "there is no fever, no contagion
here."</p>

<p>Wondering still, I entered the narrow passage,
and beyond it a dimly lighted room.</p>

<p>On the floor lay a long wooden stretcher
covered with hide; at its foot and head, fixed
each in a rude socket, were two candles, still
unlighted. A brass pot with long chains, and
a heap of dark cloth, lay upon the floor; there
was also a rough table on which stood a bottle
of water and a loaf of bread; otherwise,
except for a dim lamp upon the wall, the room
was empty. Do&ntilde;a Orosia looked around, with
quick eyes taking in every detail; then she
turned to Padre Felipe.</p>

<p>"Can you trust the bearers?"</p>

<p>He bowed his head.</p>

<p>"Then the only difficulty is this old woman.
Better to leave her behind."</p>

<p>But again I pleaded most earnestly; and
presently the friar left the room and returned
soon after with a dingy cloak, with which he
enveloped the poor dame from head to foot.</p>

<p>"Let her follow behind," he said, "and if
there is no trouble she may pass out with us."
He charged her, then, to keep her face hidden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and to stand well away from the light of the
candles.</p>

<p>After that there was a pause, and the Spanish
woman and the friar looked at each other.</p>

<p>"See you do not fail!" she said.</p>

<p>"And remember your word," he replied.</p>

<p>"A solid silver service for the new mission
chapel at San Juan,&mdash;I swear it," was the quick
response; "that is, if you succeed."</p>

<p>The friar folded his arms silently.</p>

<p>"Nay, then, in any case! only do your
utmost," whispered Do&ntilde;a Orosia hurriedly.</p>

<p>"The result is as God wills it," said Padre
Felipe calmly, and, pointing to the stretcher,
he bade me lie down upon it. I did so,
trembling in every limb, and he would have
covered me over with the wrappings when
the Governor's wife pushed him aside, knelt
down herself, and slipped into my hand a little
dagger, whispering:</p>

<p>"In case you are discovered."</p>

<p>I hid it in my bosom, thanking her. "Farewell,
se&ntilde;ora," I said, with tears, "you have
been kind to me and I am very grateful.
Whether or not I win freedom and friends, I
believe you have done your utmost for me.
I cannot think"&mdash;and I lifted my head close
to hers and whispered&mdash;"I cannot think it is
for revenge alone. There must be some pity
prompting it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou little foolish one," she said, and
laughed, pushing me back upon the bier.
Then suddenly I felt a hot tear drop upon
my forehead. She stooped lower and kissed
me on the cheek.</p>

<p>I gave a little cry and would have risen
again; but she drew the dark coverings over
me and I could see no longer. As I felt her
soft hands tucking me in, as a mother would
her babe, I could only weep silently and pray
God bless her.</p>

<p>A pungent smoke of something burning filled
the room and reached me even through the coverings.
I heard the padre lighting the tapers at
my head and feet. After a time the stretcher
on which I lay was lifted up and carried, foot
foremost, from the room&mdash;out of the passage
and into the street. I heard the feet of my
bearers pattering on the ground as we moved
onward at a swinging pace; I was conscious
of the heavy smoke of burning incense that
enveloped us; I heard the sound of a bell going
before me, and a voice raised in a steady
cry of warning; but I could see nothing save
a faint radiance through the wrappings, where
the candles burned.</p>

<p>After a time there was a halt and I heard
voices in dispute. My fingers closed around
the hilt of the se&ntilde;ora's dagger. If death must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
come, so be it! I thought, and felt no fear,
only regret that my dear love could never understand,
unless the spirit that quivered so
wildly within my still and shrouded form
could speed to him in the first moment of
its freedom and whisper the truth to his
heart!</p>

<p>Another voice joined in. It was Melinza's
own.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" he called loudly. "Out of
the way, slaves! Who dares dispute the orders
of his Excellency? If a man goes within
twenty paces of that leprous crew he may
follow them to perdition; but there'll be
no longer any room for him within these
walls!"</p>

<p>A murmur rose, and died away in the distance.
We moved on once more. Then
sounded the rattling clang of iron bars&mdash;but
it came from behind us. The bell had ceased
to ring; but as we moved slowly on I heard
the voice of the padre chanting in a low and
solemn key. Then utter silence fell, except
the unshod footfall of my bearers and a murmur
as of night-winds in the trees. Suddenly
an owl hooted overhead, and then&mdash;&mdash;I must
have fainted.</p>

<p>I thought I was again in the Barbadian
sloop, during the storm. Bound in my narrow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
berth I rocked and swayed, while overhead the
boisterous wind howled in the rigging. The
strained timbers creaked and groaned, and now
and then sounded the sharp snapping of some
frail spar. A woman's sobbing reached me
through it all,&mdash;the low, gasping sobs of one
whose breath is spent. I pushed back the covers
and looked around me.</p>

<p>It was gray dawn in the forest. Through
the tossing branches overhead I saw the
pale clouds scudding beneath an angry heaven.
I looked toward my feet and perceived the
back of a strange man with dark head, bent
shoulders, and bare brown arms grasping the
sides of my litter. Some one was at my head
also; turning quickly, I met his eyes looking
into mine: it was Padre Felipe. I sat up,
with a sudden gasp.</p>

<p>"Barbara!" I cried, "where are you, Barbara?"</p>

<p>When only the weak sobs answered me I
threw myself from the litter to the ground, falling
in an impotent heap with my feet entangled
in the wrappings. But I caught sight of my
good dame staggering on behind, half dragged,
half carried by two Indian youths. Her clothing
was torn and draggled, her face pitiably
scratched, while great tears chased each other
down her wrinkled cheeks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The litter had stopped. Padre Felipe
helped me to my feet; but I turned from him
and threw my arms around Barbara's neck.
She clung to me desperately, her breath
catching and her voice broken as she tried to
speak.</p>

<p>The friar took her by the shoulder roughly.</p>

<p>"She is worn out with tramping through
the woods all night. It is no wonder! But
'twas her own doing, for she would come; now
she must keep up or be left behind. We
must reach shelter before the storm breaks in
earnest, for it will be no light one."</p>

<p>A heavier gust passed while he was speaking;
there was a louder moan in the tree-tops,
and a broken branch crashed down at our very
feet.</p>

<p>"Have we much farther to go?" I asked.
He shook his head.</p>

<p>"About a league, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Not more," was his reply.</p>

<p>"Then put the poor dame in the litter, and
I will walk."</p>

<p>He looked intently at me. "Can you do
it?"</p>

<p>"Better than she. I feel faint here," I
added, laying my hand upon my bosom, "but
my limbs are young and strong and unwearied."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"You want food," was his brief comment;
and, turning to the litter, he drew out from a
concealed pouch that was slung beneath it, a
bottle of water, and a loaf of bread, and gave
me to drink and to eat. I took it gladly, and
Barbara did likewise. I thought, then, he
would have taken some himself; but he put by
the remainder, saying he had no need of it, and
signed to the old woman to take her place in
the litter, which was then raised by two of his
followers. The third went in advance to clear
away obstacles from the path, and we followed
behind, I clinging to the padre's arm.</p>

<p>He said no more to me, but the touch of
his hand was not ungentle. I marked how he
led me over the smoothest ground, choosing
the briars himself, though his feet were bare,
and shielding me with his arm from the sharp
blades of the dwarf palmettos that hedged the
way.</p>

<p>As I walked beside him I could but marvel
at the strange turns of Fate; for now it seemed
that I would owe my deliverance, in part, to
one of the very class I most hated as being
the first cause of our captivity. From time to
time I glanced up at his dark, stern face, and
wondered whether, if I had not chanced to
be his charge and under his sworn protection,
he could have found it in his heart to burn
me for a heretic!</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> light grew ever stronger behind the
hurrying clouds, but the deep places in the
forest held their shadows still. Tall cypress-trees
reared their heads amid the hollows and
spread their branches like a wide canopy over
our heads; huge live-oaks crowned the hummocks;
and here and there great laurels
lifted their pyramids of glossy, dark-green
foliage. Our passage was frequently obstructed
by fallen logs, mossed over with the growth
of years; and tangles of vine, tough-stemmed
and supple, flung themselves from tree to tree
across our path, resisting our advance. All
through the forest's higher corridors howled
the riotous wind; but along the tunneled ways
we traveled it was scarce perceptible at times.</p>

<p>In spite of my fatigue I felt a greater
strength rising within me. We had come so
far without pursuit! I began to hope as I had
never done before; for was not my dear love
free, and my face also set toward friends?</p>

<p>As I mused thus we reached a higher level,
and, through a rent in the stormy sky a shaft
of morning sunlight glanced across my shoulder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and plunged forward into the woods beyond.
I looked back, startled, and for a brief moment
saw the sun's golden disc; then a black cloud
effaced it from the sky.</p>

<p>"Padre!" I cried, "we are travelling westward!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said calmly.</p>

<p>"Westward!" I exclaimed again. "Westward&mdash;and
inland! when the English settlement
lies to the north of us, upon the coast!"</p>

<p>He bowed again in silent acquiescence.
Then my indignation broke forth, and without
stopping for further question I accused him
bitterly of breach of trust.</p>

<p>"Did you not promise Do&ntilde;a Orosia to
deliver me to my friends?" I cried.</p>

<p>"What cause have you to doubt my good
faith?" he asked, turning his sombre eyes
toward me, but still speaking in the same calm
tones. "Had I a ship at San Augustin in
which we could set sail? Or could such a ship
have left the harbour unperceived? Not even
a canoe could have been obtained there without
danger of discovery. We have a long
journey before us,&mdash;could we set out upon it
unprovisioned?"</p>

<p>I hung my head, ashamed, of my doubts.
Once it was not my nature to be suspicious;
but so much of trouble had come to me of late<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that I began to fear I would never again feel
the same confidence in my fellow creatures,
the same implicit trust in Heaven that I had
held two years ago. I had never been a
stranger to trouble; but, as a child, I knew it
only as a formless cloud that cast its shadow
sometimes on my path, dimming the sunlight
for a moment and hushing the song upon my
lips. Even when my mother died I was too
young for more than a child's grief&mdash;an April
shower of tears; and although my earliest
maidenhood was often lonely, I had made me
my own happiness with bright imaginings,
and prayed God to bring them to pass. So I
awaited my future always with a smile and
never doubted that it would be fair. All that
had gone by. Trouble had shown its face to
me, and I knew it for something terrible and
strong, ready to leap at my throat and crush
life out of me. What wonder, then, that I
walked fearfully from hour to hour?</p>

<p>Padre Felipe spoke again after a time.
"The woods are thinning," he said. "A few
more steps and we shall come out on the
shores of the San Juan, near to a small village
of the Yemassees, in which there are many
whose eyes have been opened to the truth.
There we shall find shelter from the storm,
and means to pursue our journey when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
clouds are past. Let us hasten; the bearers
with the litter are far ahead."</p>

<p>He gave me his arm once more, and ere
many minutes were past, we came in sight of
the bold stream of the San Juan and the
crowded huts of an Indian village.</p>

<p>The settlement did not appear to be near so
large as that at Santa Catalina, nor did the
buildings seem of as great size and commodiousness.
The most imposing edifice I took
to be the mission chapel, for before it was the
great cross mounted aloft. It was circular in
shape, with mud walls, and a thatched roof
rising to an apex. There was a door in the
side, of heavy planks battened strongly
together; but I could perceive no windows,
only a few very small square apertures, close
under the eaves, for light and air.</p>

<p>The clouds were beginning to spill great
drops upon our heads, so we quickened our
steps into a run. The litter and its bearers
had paused beside the door of the chapel, and
from the neighbouring huts several Indians
emerged and advanced to meet us. A young
woman with a little copper-coloured babe
strapped to her back, its tiny head just visible
over her shoulder, peered at us from the low
doorway of her mud-walled dwelling, but meeting
my eyes, drew back hastily out of sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>I was very weary, and Barbara, who had
dismounted from the litter, seemed unable to
stand. The padre was holding converse with
those of his dark-skinned flock who had approached;
so we two women crouched down
under the chapel eaves and gazed around us at
the wind-tossed, rain-blurred scene.</p>

<p>Before us was a thick grove of trees; to the
left we could catch glimpses of the river, gray
and angry like the sky, and all along its banks
the huddled dwellings of the poor barbarians,
whose ideals of architecture were no whit better
than those of the wasp,&mdash;not near so complex
as those of the ant and the bee.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while we waited there forlorn, my
thoughts flew back to an English home, with
its ivied walls, its turreted roof, its long fa&ccedil;ade
of warm red brick. I saw green slopes, broad
terraces, a generous portal, and a spacious hall;
I thought of a room with an ample chimney
set round with painted tiles, and I pictured
myself kneeling upon the bearskin rug before
a blazing fire, with my head upon my mother's
knee and her fingers toying with my hair.
For that moment I forgot even my dear love,
and I would have given all the world just to
be a little child at home.</p>

<p>The padre turned to us at last and motioned
us to follow him. He led us to the rear of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
chapel, where, plastered against the wall, was
a semicircular excrescence,&mdash;a tiny cell, with a
narrow door hewn from a single plank and
fastened with a heavy padlock. Drawing
forth a key from his belt he unlocked this and
bade us enter. We did so, and he closed the
door behind us.</p>

<p>Within, the hard earth floor was slightly
raised and covered with mats of woven palmetto-leaves.
A narrow chink in the wall
admitted a faint ray of light, enabling us to
perceive dimly the few objects which the
room contained. Apparently it was Padre
Felipe's sleeping apartment and the chapel
vestry combined in one. There was a curtained
doorway that gave access to the chapel itself;
pushing aside the hangings, we could see the
dim interior, empty except for the high altar
set with tall candles, and a carven crucifix
upon the wall.</p>

<p>As I caught sight of these emblems of a
Christian faith I bethought me of the bloody
sacrifices that had been offered to a pitiful
God in the name of orthodoxy, and I wondered
whether heretics like us would not be safer
out in the wild woods and the driving storm&mdash;aye,
even at the mercy of infidel barbarians;
but suddenly I remembered the solid silver
service which was to be the gift of Do&ntilde;a Orosia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to this little new mission, and I took courage.</p>

<p>The rain was now pouring in torrents from
the thatched roof, and the wind, which blew
from the northeast, dashed it back against the
mud walls of our refuge. I turned to Barbara
and gave voice to an anxiety that for some
time, had been growing within me.</p>

<p>"Dear dame," I said, "think you this storm
is worse at sea?"</p>

<p>"Aye, my lamb,'tis from an ugly quarter;
but the <i>Carolina</i> has weathered harder blows,
and haply she has found good anchorage in
some safe harbour."</p>

<p>I tried to think the same; nevertheless, in
the long hours that we sat there, listening to
the heavy gusts and beating rain, my heart
went faint at the possibility of this new danger
to my beloved.</p>

<p>It must have been past noon when the padre
came to us again. He brought food with him
freshly cooked,&mdash;meat and fish, and broth of
parched corn-flour, not unpleasant to the
taste.</p>

<p>"The wind is abating," he declared, "and
the clouds are breaking away. When the
rain ceases we may venture to pursue our
journey."</p>

<p>I begged to know how he purposed to convey<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
us, for neither Barbara nor I could go
afoot much longer.</p>

<p>Then he laid his plans before us. This
wide river, the San Juan, flowing by the settlement,
continues northward for many miles
and then curves eastward and empties itself
into the sea. We were to start in two swift
canoes&mdash;piraguas, he styled them&mdash;and, keeping
at first under the lee of the shore, follow
the river to its mouth, then proceed up the
coast along the safe passage afforded by an
outlying chain of islands. It would be a journey
of about ten days to the Indian settlement
at Santa Helena; the Indians there, he explained,
were allies of our English friends and
would doubtless aid us to rejoin them.</p>

<p>I asked if we must pass by Santa Catalina;
and he said 'twas on our way, but no one
there would hinder us while we were under
his protection.</p>

<p>"Unless," he added, "the Governor of San
Augustin sends out a ship to intercept us
there, or anywhere upon the way; in which
case there will be naught for me to do but
give you up to him."</p>

<p>Upon that I was in a fever to be gone; for
I felt that the day could not pass by without
Melinza's discovering my flight, and I would
endure any hardship rather than risk his intercepting
us.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not until the rain-clouds had all
passed by that the padre chose to embark.
The wind was still high, and our frail canoes
were roughly cradled on the river's turbulent
bosom.</p>

<p>Padre Felipe, Barbara, and I, with two Indians,
filled the smaller of the two piraguas;
the other held five Indians and a store of provisions
for the journey.</p>

<p>The afternoon sky was naught but windy
gloom; white clouds rolled over us in billowy
folds, and tattered scarves of mist trailed
lower still and seemed almost to snare their
fringes on the topmost branches of the forest.
Close under the protecting river-bank sped our
light canoes, cutting their way through the
gray waters. The dark-skinned crews bent to
the paddle silently, with corded muscles
tightening in their lean brown arms, and still,
impassive faces fixed upon the seething current
or the swiftly flying shores.</p>

<p>The gloom deepened slowly with the coming
of the night. The waters darkened, the
dun forest became black and vague. At last,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
to my eyes, it seemed that the sailing shadows
in the sky, the inky, swirling stream, and the
mysterious shores blended in one all-pervading
impenetrable midnight. I could not realize
that we were moving; it seemed, rather, that
we alone were still, while over us and around
us the spirits of the night flew past. I felt
the wind of unseen wings lifting my hair; I
heard the splash and gurgle of strange creatures
swimming by. With my hands close
locked on Barbara's arm, and wide eyes staring
into nothingness, I waited for some human
sound to break the palpitating silence.</p>

<p>Finally the padre spoke. He asked some
question in the Indian tongue. One of the
rowers grunted in reply, and there was a sudden
cessation of the rapid paddle-strokes.
Then a signal was given to the other canoe,
and after some further discussion I felt that
we approached the shore. There was a
scraping, jarring sound, followed by the soft
trampling of feet upon a marshy bank; and
then a hand drew me up and guided me to
land.</p>

<p>"The tide is running too strongly against
us," explained the voice of Padre Felipe.
"We will rest an hour or two and wait for it
to turn."</p>

<p>They kindled a fire somehow and spread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
a blanket upon the damp ground. I remember
that Barbara and I stretched ourselves upon
it and I laid my head against the dame's
shoulder,&mdash;then weariness overcame me.</p>

<p>It seemed the very next moment that I
was roused; but the fire was out, and in the
sky glimmered a few dim stars. There was
a strange calm reigning as we re-embarked;
for the wind had died and the whole aspect
of the night had changed. All around us a
faintly luminous sky lifted itself above the
dense horizon line, and the broad bosom of
the river paled to the hue of molten lead.
Still brighter grew the heavens; the thin
clouds drew aside, and the crescent of a waning
moon spilled glory over us. And now our
dark piraguas sped over the surface of a silver
stream, and every paddle-blade dripped
diamonds.</p>

<p>It is a noble river, this San Juan, with its
broad sweeps and curves. At times it widens
to a lake, and again thrusts itself into the
shores as though its waters filled the print of
some giant hand that in ages past had rested
heavily with outspread fingers on the yielding
soil. Aided by the strong current we glided
on as swiftly as the passing hours. Our
faces were set eastward now, and I waited,
breathless, for the day to wake.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a slow parting of the filmy skies,
as though Dawn's rosy fingers brushed aside the
curtains of her couch; then came a gleam of
golden hair that slid across her downy pillows.
A long-drawn sigh shivered across the silent
world, and with a sudden dazzlement we saw&mdash;</p>

<p class="pub1">&mdash;"the opening eyelids of the Morn."</p>

<p>From the southwest a fresh wind arose and
swept clean the blue heavens; and, with the
early sunbeams sparkling on the ripples of
the tide, the canoes darted on toward the
river's mouth. A heron flew up from the
marshes suddenly, and sailed over our heads
on its strong white wings. As I watched it
dip out of sight in the river far beyond us I
caught sight of another gleaming wing that
slowly unfurled itself toward the sky.</p>

<p>Touching the padre's arm, I pointed to it.</p>

<p>"A sail!" he said.</p>

<p>Our canoes quickly sought the curve of the
shore and crept with caution toward the unknown
vessel.</p>

<p>"It can scarcely be the Habana ship,"
murmured the padre, "for the <i>Virgen de la
Mar</i> was at anchor in the harbour when we
left San Augustin, and ere morning the storm
had risen, so she would hardly have ventured
forth to sea."</p>

<p>"There are other vessels carrying sail that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
ply between the fort and these coast islands.
We came from Santa Catalina aboard one of
them," I whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the padre, "but this is too
large." He paused for some moments, and
then added: "Do you see the long, straight
lines of her hull, and the square stern? This
is no Spanish galley, but a frigate of English
build."</p>

<p>"'Tis the <i>Carolina</i>!" I exclaimed, "'tis the
<i>Carolina</i>!"</p>

<p>"Oh! the blessed, blessed English ship!"
sobbed the good dame.</p>

<p>Then all energies were bent to reach her,
for it was plain that she was making ready
to leave her anchorage.</p>

<p>"If we could only signal to those on board!"
I cried. "Loose your neck-kerchief, Barbara,
and wave it&mdash;wave it in the sunlight!"</p>

<p>"We are too close to the shore," the padre
said. "She can scarce distinguish us until we
strike out into the open."</p>

<p>"But how plainly we can perceive her crew!
And see the stir upon the decks&mdash;are they
not drawing up the anchor? Oh, Padre
Felipe!" I cried piteously, "wave to them!
signal them! or they will leave us after all!"</p>

<p>The friar rose carefully to his feet; he, too,
was heartily glad of this chance to be rid of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
his charges, and in no mind to let it slip by.
With Barbara's white kerchief in his hand he
was about to make another effort to attract
the notice of the <i>Carolina</i>, when suddenly he
glanced over his shoulder toward the land,
his hand fell quickly to his side, and he
dropped back into his seat with an exclamation
of dismay.</p>

<p>One of the Indians rose immediately, and
with shaded eyes gazed along the beach as it
stretched away southward to San Augustin.
He gave a grunt of acquiescence and sat down,
and the motion of the paddles ceased.</p>

<p>"What have you seen?" I cried in agony,
struggling also to my feet.</p>

<p>We were so near the river's mouth&mdash;almost
upon the blue waves of the ocean rolling out
to the shining east! Under the lee of the
northern shore lay the English ship; and south
of us the coast spun out its gleaming line of
sandy beach away, away back to the prison we
had left. But what were those dark forms
that swarmed the sands?</p>

<p>"We are too late!" muttered the Spanish
friar. "Discovering your flight, they have not
waited for calm weather to follow in a swift
sailing-vessel, as I had thought they would,
but have sent out a search-party afoot to
overtake you at the outset."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"But we must reach the <i>Carolina</i> before
they arrive, Padre!"</p>

<p>"It can be done, easy enough," he answered,
"but what shall I and my followers do if we
are seen? Girl, I have too much at stake! I
choose not to incur the Governor's anger.
'Tis not likely that they connect us with your
disappearance, for Do&ntilde;a Orosia swore to shield
me in the matter. I have done all I could.
It is thus far and no farther. But you may
yet escape; 'tis only a little distance to the
ship; take up the paddles and make your way
thither."</p>

<p>As he spoke he stepped from our canoe to
the larger one which had closed up with us,
and the two Indians followed him.</p>

<p>"Padre! oh, Padre! Do not leave me, do
not desert me!"</p>

<p>They paid no heed to my appeal save to
give a mighty shove to our canoe that sent it
out toward midstream; then, seizing their
paddles, with swift strokes they sent their own
piragua speeding up the river.</p>

<p>It had all passed so quickly&mdash;so suddenly
our hopes had been destroyed! Barbara and I
had been thrown forward by the impetus
given to our frail boat, and we cowered down
in silence for a moment. The current was
still bearing us outward; but every second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
our motion slackened: we would never reach
the ship without some effort on our part.</p>

<p>I seized a paddle and worked vigorously;
but the light boat only swung round and
round.</p>

<p>"Barbara!" I cried, "take the other paddle
and work with me. I can do nothing all
alone!"</p>

<p>The dame obeyed me, sobbing and praying
under her breath; but we made sorry work of
it.</p>

<p>I looked shoreward and could see our pursuers
drawing closer and closer; they had not
yet perceived us, but in a moment more they
could not fail to do so. As they drew still
nearer, riding on his dappled gray in the midst
of them, I recognized Melinza! With him
were a troop of Spanish soldiers&mdash;I saw the
sunlight flashing on their arms&mdash;and some
twenty half-naked Indians, who might so
easily swim out and drag us back to land!</p>

<p>"They see us! Mistress Margaret, they see
us!" shouted Barbara.</p>

<p>"Oh! not yet, dame, not yet!" I groaned,
plying the paddle wildly.</p>

<p>"The English, my lamb&mdash;the English see us!
Look you, they are putting put a boat from
the ship!"</p>

<p>It was true; but ere I could utter a "Thank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
God!" a yell from the shore told us that those
fiends had seen us also. Barbara would have
dropped her paddle in despair, but I ordered
her sternly to make what play she could.
As for me, I dipped my blade now on one side,
now on the other; the trick of it had come to
me like an inspiration; my fingers tightened
their hold, and my arms worked with the
strength born of a great terror.</p>

"NEARER CAME THE LONG BOAT, YET NEARER WAS THE
FOREMOST SWIMMER."&mdash;<i>Page 162.</i></div>

<p>Our pursuers had reached the river-shore,
and a swarm of dark forms now threw themselves
into the stream. But the long-boat
from the frigate came toward us rapidly; I saw
white English faces and heard shouts of
encouragement in my mother tongue.</p>

<p>Then a volley of musketry rang out from the
land. Instantly, the frigate made response;
her heavy guns thundered forth, and the
white smoke wreathed her like a cloud. But
all the shots were falling short.</p>

<p>Nearer came the long-boat, yet nearer was
the foremost swimmer. I saw his brown arms
cleaving the clear tide, I saw the white eyeballs
gleaming in his dark face. Friends and foes
were now so close together that from the shore
it was impossible to distinguish them; so the
shots had ceased, and in their place rang out
wild curses and savage yells. A sinewy brown
hand rose from the water and seized the edge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of our frail canoe, tilting it far over. The sudden
jerk destroyed my balance, and in a moment
I felt the waters close over my head.</p>

<p>Strong hands grasped me as I rose again
and I battled fiercely; for I thought the
Indian had me in his hold, and I chose rather,
to die. But my weak strength was overcome,
and I was lifted&mdash;aye, thank God!&mdash;lifted into
the English boat, and Master Collins wiped
the water from my face.</p>

<p>I saw them drag the dame in also, and then
I closed my eyes. I did not faint,&mdash;never in
all my life had I been so very much alive; but
the sunlight and the blue sky were too bright
for me.</p>

<p>I cannot tell much of what followed. There
were a few more shots, and one of the English
sailors dropped his oar and held up a
bleeding hand. I sought my kerchief to bind
it up for him, but I could not find it. And
then, I looked up and saw the <i>Carolina</i> close
beside us. A ringing cheer went up to heaven,
and kind hands raised me to the deck. The
sunburnt face of Captain Brayne bent over
me, and there were tears in his honest eyes.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were other women on the ship, and
one of them came forward and led me away
to her cabin and aided me to rid myself of my
drenched garments, lending me others in their
stead. I learned from her that the <i>Carolina</i>
had come direct from Barbadoes, bearing
freight and some very few passengers,&mdash;the
noise of our treatment at the Spaniards' hands
deterring many who would else have ventured
to throw in their lot with the young colony.
Captain Brayne bore also the duplicate of the
orders of the Spanish Council&mdash;which had been
forwarded from England to Barbadoes; and
he had been instructed by their Lordships
the Proprietors, to stop at San Augustin and
demand the prisoners.</p>

<p>All this my new friend told me during her
kindly ministrations. She asked, also, many
questions concerning my escape and the treatment
I had received during our long captivity;
but I was too exhausted to answer these at
length, and begged that I might be left awhile
to rest. She went away then, to get me a soothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
potion from the ship's surgeon; and I made
haste to unwrap the little packet that had lain
hidden in my bosom, in which was the written
story of my prison life. As I smoothed out the
damp pages I thought of how I would place
it in my dear love's hand and leave him to
read all that my tongue could never say to
him!</p>

<p>I slept for some hours and woke refreshed.
Then came a message from the captain, asking
if I would see him. I was eager to be out,
for many reasons, the chief being my desire
to see him from whom I had been so long
parted; it was his face I sought first among
the many familiar ones that crowded round
me. Besides Captain Brayne I recognized
other officers of the <i>Carolina</i> as the same with
whom I had sailed from the Downs nearly two
years ago. All my fellow prisoners&mdash;save
one&mdash;greeted me joyfully and kindly. But
that one missing face&mdash;where was it?</p>

<p>It was on my tongue to ask for Mr. Rivers;
then, of a sudden, it came over me <i>how</i> we
had parted. So! and he still believed me&mdash;that
thing which I had shown myself. He
had nursed his doubts for two whole days and
nights, and now he would not even come forward
to touch my hand and wish me joy of
my escape. It seemed to me I caught glances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
of pity passing between one and another of
the lookers-on. Did they wait to see how
Margaret Tudor would bear her lover's apathy?
A jilted maid!</p>

<p>There was a mist before my eyes; but I
smiled and said little gracious words of thanks
to each and all of them, and wished in my
heart that I was dead. Oh, my love! whatever
doubts you may have had of me were
paid back that cruel moment in full measure.
I recalled some of the hard speeches I had
heard from the embittered Spanish woman,
and I thought within myself, All men are
made after the same pattern!</p>

<p>Captain Brayne and Master Collins and good
old Captain Baulk of the <i>Three Brothers</i> had
been in earnest conversation for some moments;
and now the <i>Carolina's</i> commander came to
me and took me gently by the hand, leading
me aside.</p>

<p>"Mistress Margaret," he said, "there is one
aboard this ship to whom your coming may
mean life instead of death. He is very ill,&mdash;so
ill that we despaired of him till now,&mdash;and one
name is ever on his lips. Are you too weak
and unstrung, my dear young lady, to go with
me to his sick bed?"</p>

<p>That was how the truth came to me. I cannot
write of what I felt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take me to him," I said.</p>

<p>He lay in his berth; his large eyes were
alight with fever, and he was talking ceaselessly,
now in broken whispers, now with a
proud defiance in his husky tones.</p>

<p>"God knows what the devils did to him,"
murmured Henry Brayne. "He was once a
proper figure of a man; but starvation and ill
usage have worn him to a shadow!"</p>

<p>Aye, but a shadow with a gnawing sorrow
at its heart.</p>

<p>"You may taunt me, Se&ntilde;or de Melinza,"
whispered the broken voice, "you may taunt
me with my helplessness. I may not break
these bonds, it is true; but neither can you
sever those that bind to me the love of a true-hearted
English maid.... That is a foul lie,
Don Pedro, and I cast it back into your teeth!...
Strike a helpless prisoner? Do so, and
you add but another black deed to the long
score that stands against the name of Spaniard.
Some day the reckoning will come, se&ntilde;or&mdash;I
dare stake my soul on that!... I'll not believe
it; no! not upon your oath, Don Pedro!...
Margaret, Margaret! Tell him he lies,
dear lady!... In God's name, speak, sweetheart!"
And though I knelt beside him, and
called his name again and again, he was deaf
to my voice and put me by with feeble hands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
crying ever: "Margaret! Margaret!" till I
thought my heart would break.</p>

<p>Oh! the terror of this new jailer&mdash;dread
Disease&mdash;that held him in its grip while
Death lurked grimly in the background!
For no wiles or blandishments of mine could
move them or loose their hold upon the life
most dear to me. When there was but man
to deal with, my faith failed me and I ceased
praying; now it was my punishment that
only God's mercy could set my dear love free,&mdash;and
it might be his pleasure to loose him in
another world and leave me still on earth to
mourn his loss.</p>

<p>As, hour after hour, I listened to his ravings,
a deeper understanding of the horrors of his
long captivity began to grow upon me. I
could scarce forbear crying out when I thought
how I had touched the hand of that vile
Spaniard, and listened, smiling, when he spoke
of love to me.</p>

<p>How terrible a thing is hatred! Heaven
pardon me, but I think there is somewhat of
it in my heart. Yet, now that the fever is
abating, and my beloved is coming back to me
from the very brink of the grave, I do pray
that I may forgive mine enemy, even as God
in His clemency has pardoned me!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p><hr class="min" />

<p>He knows me at last. It was some hours
ago. I was bending over him, and a light of
recognition dawned in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Margaret! <i>Margaret!</i> is it <i>you</i>? I
dreamed just now&mdash;&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;that you were
untrue to me!"</p>

<p>"Did you so, dear love?" I answered.
"Forget it then, and rest; for now the fever
and the dreams are past."</p>

<p>He smiled at me and fell asleep like a little
child.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>In the long hours that I have watched beside
him I have written these last pages of
my story; and some time, when he is awake
and strong enough to bear the truth, I will
put them all into his hand and leave him here
alone. And I think, when he has read them
through to the end, he will discern&mdash;between
the lines&mdash;more of my heart than I have words
to tell.</p>
